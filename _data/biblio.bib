	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Simultaneous mapping of multiple behavioral domains into brain networks remains a major challenge. Here, we shed some light on this problem by employing a combination of machine learning, structural and functional brain networks at different spatial resolutions (also known as scales), together with performance scores across multiple neurobehavioral domains, including sensation, motor skills, and cognition. Provided by the Human Connectome Project, we make use of three cohorts: 640 participants for model training, 160 subjects for validation, and 200 subjects for model performance testing thus enhancing prediction generalization. Our modeling consists of two main stages, namely dimensionality reduction in brain network features at multiple scales, followed by canonical correlation analysis, which determines an optimal linear combination of connectivity features to predict multiple behavioral performance scores. To assess the differences in the predictive power of each modality, we separately applied three different strategies: structural unimodal, functional unimodal, and multimodal, that is, structural in combination with functional features of the brain network. Our results show that the multimodal association outperforms any of the unimodal analyses. Then, to answer which human brain structures were most involved in predicting multiple behavioral scores, we simulated different synthetic scenarios in which in each case we completely deleted a brain structure or a complete resting state network, and recalculated performance in its absence. In deletions, we found critical structures to affect performance when predicting single behavioral domains, but this occurred in a lesser manner for prediction of multi-domain behavior. Overall, our results confirm that although there are synergistic contributions between brain structure and function that enhance behavioral prediction, brain networks may also be mutually redundant in predicting multidomain behavior, such that even after deletion of a structure, the connectivity of the others can compensate for its lack in predicting behavior.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Brain networks can be defined and explored through their connectivity. Here, we analyzed the relationship between structural connectivity (SC) across 2,514 regions that cover the entire brain and brainstem, and their dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). To do so, we focused on a combination of two metrics: the first assesses the degree of SC-DFC similarity -i.e. the extent to which the dynamic functional correlations can be explained by structural pathways-; and the second is the intrinsic variability of the DFC networks over time. Overall, we found that cerebellar networks have a smaller DFC variability than other networks in the brain. Moreover, the internal structure of the cerebellum could be clearly divided in two distinct posterior and anterior parts, the latter also connected to the brainstem. The mechanism to maintain small variability of the DFC in the posterior part of the cerebellum is consistent with another of our findings, namely, that this structure exhibits the highest SC-DFC similarity relative to the other networks studied, i.e. structure constrains the variation in dynamics. By contrast, the anterior part of the cerebellum also exhibits small DFC variability but it has the lowest SC-DFC similarity, suggesting a different mechanism is at play. Because this structure connects to the brainstem, which regulates sleep cycles, cardiac and respiratory functioning, we suggest that such critical functionality drives the low variability in the DFC. Overall, the low variability detected in DFC expands our current knowledge of cerebellar networks, which are extremely rich and complex, participating in a wide range of cognitive functions, from movement control and coordination to executive function or emotional regulation. Moreover, the association between such low variability and structure suggests that differentiated computational principles can be applied in the cerebellum as opposed to other structures, such as the cerebral cortex.},

              INTRODUCTION
              BrainAge models based on neuroimaging data have diagnostic classification power but have replicability issues due to site and patient variability. BrainAge models trained on neuropsychological tests could help distinguish stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) from progressive MCI (pMCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
            
            
              METHODS
              A linear regressor BrainAge model was trained on healthy controls using neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging features separately. The BrainAge delta, predicted age minus chronological age, was used to distinguish between sMCI and pMCI.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The cross‐validated area under the receiver‐operating characteristic (ROC) curve for sMCI versus pMCI was 0.91 for neuropsychological features in contrast to 0.68 for neuroimaging features. The BrainAge delta was correlated with the time to conversion, the time taken for a pMCI subject to convert to AD.
            
            
              DISCUSSION
              The BrainAge delta from neuropsychological tests is a good biomarker to distinguish between sMCI and pMCI. Other neurological and psychiatric disorders could be studied using this strategy.
            
            
              Highlights
              
                
                  
                    BrainAge models based on neuropsychological tests outperform models based on neuroimaging features when distinguishing between stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) from progressive MCI (pMCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
                  
                  
                    The combination of neuropsychological tests with neuroimaging features does not lead to an improvement in sMCI versus pMCI classification compared to using neuropsychological tests on their own.
                  
                  
                    BrainAge delta of both neuroimaging and neuropsychological models was correlated with the time to conversion, the time taken for a pMCI subject to convert to AD.},

We found that visual memory and verbal memory were better predicted by {FC}, whereas visual and motor impairments were better predicted by lesion topography. Attention and language deficits were well predicted by both. Next, we identified a general pattern of physiological network dysfunction consisting of decrease of interhemispheric integration and intrahemispheric segregation, which strongly related to behavioral impairment in multiple domains. Network-specific patterns of dysfunction predicted specific behavioral deficits, and loss of interhemispheric communication across a set of regions was associated with impairment across multiple behavioral domains.

Although rare, these cases can lend unique insight into the neurobiological substrate of criminality. Here we present a systematic mapping of lesions with known temporal association to criminal behavior, identifying 17 lesion cases. The lesion sites were spatially heterogeneous, including the medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and different locations within the bilateral temporal lobes. No single brain region was damaged in all cases. Because lesion-induced symptoms can come from sites connected to the lesion location and not just the lesion location itself, we also identified brain regions functionally connected to each lesion location. This technique, termed lesion network mapping, has recently identified regions involved in symptom generation across a variety of lesion-induced disorders. All lesions were functionally connected to the same network of brain regions. This criminality-associated connectivity pattern was unique compared with lesions causing four other neuropsychiatric syndromes. This network includes regions involved in morality, value-based decision making, and theory of mind, but not regions involved in cognitive control or empathy. Finally, we replicated our results in a separate cohort of 23 cases in which a temporal relationship between brain lesions and criminal behavior was implied but not definitive. Our results suggest that lesions in criminals occur in different brain locations but localize to a unique resting state network, providing insight into the neurobiology of criminal behavior.},

We next used a recently validated technique termed lesion network mapping to determine whether these heterogeneous lesion locations localized to specific brain networks. Lesion locations causing akinetic mutism all fell within one network, defined by connectivity to the anterior cingulate cortex. Lesion locations causing alien limb fell within a separate network, defined by connectivity to the precuneus. Both findings were specific for these syndromes compared with brain lesions causing similar physical impairments but without disordered free will. Finally, our lesion-based localization matched network localization for brain stimulation locations that disrupt free will and neuroimaging abnormalities in patients with psychiatric disorders of free will without overt brain lesions. Collectively, our results demonstrate that lesions in different locations causing disordered volition and agency localize to unique brain networks, lending insight into the neuroanatomical substrate of free will perception.},

            Inconsistent findings from migraine neuroimaging studies have limited attempts to localize migraine symptomatology. Novel brain network mapping techniques offer a new approach for linking neuroimaging findings to a common neuroanatomical substrate and localizing therapeutic targets. In this study, we attempted to determine whether neuroanatomically heterogeneous neuroimaging findings of migraine localize to a common brain network. We used meta-analytic coordinates of decreased grey matter volume in migraineurs as seed regions to generate resting state functional connectivity network maps from a normative connectome (n = 1000). Network maps were overlapped to identify common regions of connectivity across all coordinates. Specificity of our findings was evaluated using a whole-brain Bayesian spatial generalized linear mixed model and a region of interest analysis with comparison groups of chronic pain and a neurologic control (Alzheimer’s disease). We found that all migraine coordinates (11/11, 100\%) were negatively connected (t ≥ ±7, P \&lt; 10−6 family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons) to a single location in left extrastriate visual cortex overlying dorsal V3 and V3A subregions. More than 90\% of coordinates (10/11) were also positively connected with bilateral insula and negatively connected with the hypothalamus. Bayesian spatial generalized linear mixed model whole-brain analysis identified left V3/V3A as the area with the most specific connectivity to migraine coordinates compared to control coordinates (voxel-wise probability of ≥90\%). Post hoc region of interest analyses further supported the specificity of this finding ({ANOVA} P = 0.02; pairwise t-tests P = 0.03 and P = 0.003, respectively). In conclusion, using coordinate-based network mapping, we show that regions of grey matter volume loss in migraineurs localize to a common brain network defined by connectivity to visual cortex V3/V3A, a region previously implicated in mechanisms of cortical spreading depression in migraine. Our findings help unify migraine neuroimaging literature and offer a migraine-specific target for neuromodulatory treatment.},

Two recent methods allow for the estimation of structural and functional disconnection from clinical structural imaging. This is achieved by embedding a patient’s lesion into an atlas of functional and structural connections in healthy subjects, and deriving the ensemble of structural and functional connections that pass through the lesion, thus indirectly estimating its impact on the whole brain connectome. This indirect assessment of network dysfunction is more readily available than direct measures of functional and structural connectivity obtained with functional and diffusion {MRI}, respectively, and it is in theory applicable to a wide variety of disorders. To validate the clinical relevance of these methods, we quantified the prediction of behavioural deficits in a prospective cohort of 132 first-time stroke patients studied at 2 weeks post-injury (mean age 52.8 years, range 22–77; 63 females; 64 right hemispheres). Specifically, we used multivariate ridge regression to relate deficits in multiple functional domains (left and right visual, left and right motor, language, spatial attention, spatial and verbal memory) with the pattern of lesion and indirect structural or functional disconnection. In a subgroup of patients, we also measured direct alterations of functional connectivity with resting-state functional {MRI}. Both lesion and indirect structural disconnection maps were predictive of behavioural impairment in all domains (0.16 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.58) except for verbal memory (0.05 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.06). Prediction from indirect functional disconnection was scarce or negligible (0.01 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.18) except for the right visual field deficits (R2 = 0.38), even though multivariate maps were anatomically plausible in all domains. Prediction from direct measures of functional {MRI} functional connectivity in a subset of patients was clearly superior to indirect functional disconnection. In conclusion, the indirect estimation of structural connectivity damage successfully predicted behavioural deficits post-stroke to a level comparable to lesion information. However, indirect estimation of functional disconnection did not predict behavioural deficits, nor was a substitute for direct functional connectivity measurements, especially for cognitive disorders.},

We aim to investigate differences in therapy-induced resting-state functional connectivity changes between additional sensorimotor compared with motor therapy in the early-phase post stroke. Thirty first-stroke patients with a sensorimotor impairment were included for an assessor-blinded multi-centre randomized controlled trial within 8 weeks post stroke [13 (43\%) females; mean age: 67 ± 13 years; mean time post stroke: 43 ± 13 days]. Patients were randomly assigned to additional sensorimotor (n = 18) or motor (n = 12) therapy, receiving 16 h of additional therapy within 4 weeks. Sensorimotor evaluations and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were performed at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2) and after 4 weeks follow-up (T3). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was also performed in an age-matched healthy control group (n = 19) to identify patterns of aberrant connectivity in stroke patients between hemispheres, or within ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres. Mixed model analysis investigated session and treatment effects between stroke therapy groups. Non-parametric partial correlations were used to investigate brain-behaviour associations with age and frame-wise displacement as nuisance regressors. Connections within the contralesional hemisphere that showed hypo-connectivity in subacute stroke patients (compared with healthy controls) showed a trend towards a more pronounced pre-to-post normalization (less hypo-connectivity) in the motor therapy group, compared with the sensorimotor therapy group (mean estimated difference = -0.155 ± 0.061; P = 0.02). Further, the motor therapy group also tended to show a further pre-to-post increase in functional connectivity strength among connections that already showed hyper-connectivity in the stroke patients at baseline versus healthy controls (mean estimated difference = -0.144 ± 0.072; P = 0.06). Notably, these observed increases in hyper-connectivity of the contralesional hemisphere were positively associated with improvements in functional activity (r = 0.48), providing indications that these patterns of hyper-connectivity are compensatory in nature. The sensorimotor and motor therapy group showed no significant differences in terms of pre-to-post changes in inter-hemispheric connectivity or ipsilesional intrahemispheric connectivity. While effects are only tentative within this preliminary sample, results suggest a possible stronger normalization of hypo-connectivity and a stronger pre-to-post increase in compensatory hyper-connectivity of the contralesional hemisphere after motor therapy compared with sensorimotor therapy. Future studies with larger patient samples are however recommended to confirm these trend-based preliminary findings.},

More than half of the stroke patients have somatosensory impairments in the upper limb, which could hamper recovery. Question: Is sensorimotor upper limb ({UL}) therapy of more benefit for motor and somatosensory outcome than motor therapy? Design: Randomized assessor- blinded multicenter controlled trial with block randomization stratified for neglect, severity of motor impairment, and type of stroke. Participants: 40 first-ever stroke patients with {UL} sensorimotor impairments admitted to the rehabilitation center. Intervention: Both groups received 16 h of additional therapy over 4 weeks consisting of sensorimotor (N = 22) or motor (N = 18) {UL} therapy. Outcome measures: Action Research Arm test ({ARAT}) as primary outcome, and other motor and somatosensory measures were assessed at baseline, post-intervention and after 4 weeks follow-up. Results: No significant between-group differences were found for change scores in {ARAT} or any somatosensory measure between the three time points. For {UL} impairment (Fugl-Meyer assessment), a significant greater improvement was found for the motor group compared to the sensorimotor group from baseline to post-intervention [mean ({SD}) improvement 14.65 (2.19) vs. 5.99 (2.06); p = 0.01] and from baseline to follow-up [17.38 (2.37) vs. 6.75 (2.29); p = 0.003]. Conclusion: {UL} motor therapy may improve motor impairment more than {UL} sensorimotor therapy in patients with sensorimotor impairments in the early rehabilitation phase post stroke. For these patients, integrated sensorimotor therapy may not improve somatosensory function and may be less effective for motor recovery.

	abstract = {Lesion-behaviour mapping analyses require the demarcation of the brain lesion on each (usually transverse) slice of the individual stroke patient's brain image. To date, this is generally thought to be most precise when done manually, which is, however, both time-consuming and potentially observer-dependent. Fully automated lesion demarcation methods have been developed to address these issues, but these are often not practicable in acute stroke research where for each patient only a single image modality is available and the available image modality differs over patients. In the current study, we evaluated a semi-automated lesion demarcation approach, the so-called Clusterize algorithm, in acute stroke patients scanned in a range of common image modalities. Our results suggest that, compared to the standard of manual lesion demarcation, the semi-automated Clusterize algorithm is capable of significantly speeding up lesion demarcation in the most commonly used image modalities, without loss of either lesion demarcation precision or lesion demarcation reproducibility. For the three investigated acute datasets ({CT}, {DWI}, T2FLAIR), containing a total of 44 patient images obtained in a regular clinical setting at patient admission, the reduction in processing time was on average 17.8 min per patient and this advantage increased with increasing lesion volume (up to 60 min per patient for the largest lesion volumes in our datasets). Additionally, our results suggest that performance of the Clusterize algorithm in a chronic dataset with 11 T1 images was comparable to its performance in the acute datasets. We thus advocate the use of the Clusterize algorithm, integrated into a simple, freely available {SPM} toolbox, for the precise, reliable and fast preparation of imaging data for lesion-behaviour mapping analyses.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Functional limitation of the upper extremities is common in patients with stroke. An upper-extremity measure with sound psychometric properties is indispensable for clinical and research use.
{OBJECTIVE}: The purpose of this study was to compare the psychometric properties of 4 clinical measures for assessing upper-extremity motor function in people with stroke: the upper-extremity subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Test ({UE}-{FM}), the upper-extremity subscale of the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement, the Action Research Arm Test ({ARAT}), and the Wolf Motor Function Test.
{DESIGN}: This was a prospective, longitudinal study.
{METHODS}: Fifty-three people with stroke were evaluated with the 4 measures at 4 time points (14, 30, 90, and 180 days after stroke). Thirty-five participants completed all of the assessments. The ceiling and floor effects, validity (concurrent validity and predictive validity), and responsiveness of each measure were examined. Interrater reliability and test-retest reliability also were examined.
{RESULTS}: All measures, except for the {UE}-{FM}, had significant floor effects or ceiling effects at one or more time points. The Spearman rho correlation coefficient for each pair of the 4 measures was {\textgreater} or =.81, indicating high concurrent validity. The predictive validity of the 4 measures was satisfactory (Spearman rho, {\textgreater} or =.51). The responsiveness of the 4 measures at 14 to 180 days after stroke was moderate (.52 {\textless} or = effect size {\textless} or = .79). The 4 measures had good interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [{ICC}], {\textgreater} or =.92) and test-retest reliability ({ICC}, {\textgreater} or =.97). Only the minimal detectable changes of the {UE}-{FM} (8\% of the highest possible score) and the {ARAT} (6\%) were satisfactory.
{LIMITATIONS}: The sample size was too small to conduct data analysis according to type or severity of stroke. In addition, the timed component of the Wolf Motor Function Test was not used in this study.
{CONCLUSIONS}: All 4 measures showed sufficient validity, responsiveness, and reliability in participants with stroke. The {UE}-{FM} for assessing impairment and the {ARAT} for assessing disability had satisfactory minimal detectable changes, supporting their utility in clinical settings.},

{DESIGN}: Through discussions between four experienced neurophysiotherapists, the testing procedures of the revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment were further standardized. Subsequently, the intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities of the {EmNSA} were investigated.
{RESULTS}: The intra-rater reliability of the tactile sensations, sharp blunt discrimination and the proprioception items of the {EmNSA} were generally good to excellent for both raters with a range of weighted kappa coefficients between 0.58 and 1.00. Likewise the inter-rater reliabilities of these items were predominantly good to excellent with a range of weighted kappa coefficients between 0.46 and 1.00.

            Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with substantial phenotypic, biological, and etiologic heterogeneity. It remains a challenge to identify biomarkers to stratify autism into replicable cognitive or biological subtypes. Here, we aim to introduce a novel methodological framework for parsing neuroanatomical subtypes within a large cohort of individuals with autism. We used cortical thickness ({CT}) in a large and well-characterized sample of 316 participants with autism (88 female, age mean: 17.2 ± 5.7) and 206 with neurotypical development (79 female, age mean: 17.5 ± 6.1) aged 6–31 years across six sites from the {EU}-{AIMS} multi-center Longitudinal European Autism Project. Five biologically based putative subtypes were derived using normative modeling of {CT} and spectral clustering. Three of these clusters showed relatively widespread decreased {CT} and two showed relatively increased {CT}. These subtypes showed morphometric differences from one another, providing a potential explanation for inconsistent case–control findings in autism, and loaded differentially and more strongly onto symptoms and polygenic risk, indicating a dilution of clinical effects across heterogeneous cohorts. Our results provide an important step towards parsing the heterogeneous neurobiology of autism.},

Individual probabilistic tractography analyses were conducted in 100 subjects using the highest resolution data currently available. Tractography results were refined using a novel algorithm to objectively determine slice level thresholds that best minimized overlap between tracts while preserving tract volume. Consistent with tracing studies in monkey and rodent, our observations show that cortical topography is generally preserved through the internal capsule, with the {preSMA} tract remaining most anterior and the primary somatosensory tract remaining most posterior. We combine our results into a freely available white matter template named the {SMATT}. We also provide a probabilistic {SMATT} that quantifies the extent of overlap between tracts. Finally, we assess how the {SMATT} operates at the individual subject level in another independent data set, and in an individual after stroke. The {SMATT} and probabilistic {SMATT} provide new tools that segment and label sensorimotor tracts at a spatial resolution not previously available.},

	abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity {MRI}. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex ({MT}+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the {MT}+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

In this study we explored the organization of cerebrocerebellar circuits in the human using resting-state functional connectivity {MRI} ({fcMRI}). Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using nonlinear deformation of the cerebellum in combination with surface-based alignment of the cerebral cortex. The foot, hand, and tongue representations were localized in subjects performing movements. {fcMRI} maps derived from seed regions placed in different parts of the motor body representation yielded the expected inverted map of somatomotor topography in the anterior lobe and the upright map in the posterior lobe. Next, we mapped the complete topography of the cerebellum by estimating the principal cerebral target for each point in the cerebellum in a discovery sample of 500 subjects and replicated the topography in 500 independent subjects. The majority of the human cerebellum maps to association areas. Quantitative analysis of 17 distinct cerebral networks revealed that the extent of the cerebellum dedicated to each network is proportional to the network's extent in the cerebrum with a few exceptions, including primary visual cortex, which is not represented in the cerebellum. Like somatomotor representations, cerebellar regions linked to association cortex have separate anterior and posterior representations that are oriented as mirror images of one another. The orderly topography of the representations suggests that the cerebellum possesses at least two large, homotopic maps of the full cerebrum and possibly a smaller third map.},

The topography of the complete striatum was estimated and replicated by assigning each voxel in the striatum to its most strongly correlated cortical network in two independent groups of 500 subjects. The results revealed at least five cortical zones in the striatum linked to sensorimotor, premotor, limbic, and two association networks with a topography globally consistent with monkey anatomical studies. The majority of the human striatum was coupled to cortical association networks. Examining these association networks further revealed details that fractionated the five major networks.

	abstract = {Background
              Functional limitation of the upper extremities is common in patients with stroke. An upper-extremity measure with sound psychometric properties is indispensable for clinical and research use.
            
            
              Objective
              The purpose of this study was to compare the psychometric properties of 4 clinical measures for assessing upper-extremity motor function in people with stroke: the upper-extremity subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Test ({UE}-{FM}), the upper-extremity subscale of the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement, the Action Research Arm Test ({ARAT}), and the Wolf Motor Function Test.
            
            
              Design
              This was a prospective, longitudinal study.
            
            
              Methods
              Fifty-three people with stroke were evaluated with the 4 measures at 4 time points (14, 30, 90, and 180 days after stroke). Thirty-five participants completed all of the assessments. The ceiling and floor effects, validity (concurrent validity and predictive validity), and responsiveness of each measure were examined. Interrater reliability and test-retest reliability also were examined.
            
            
              Results
              All measures, except for the {UE}-{FM}, had significant floor effects or ceiling effects at one or more time points. The Spearman ρ correlation coefficient for each pair of the 4 measures was ≥.81, indicating high concurrent validity. The predictive validity of the 4 measures was satisfactory (Spearman ρ, ≥.51). The responsiveness of the 4 measures at 14 to 180 days after stroke was moderate (.52 ≤ effect size ≤ .79). The 4 measures had good interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [{ICC}], ≥.92) and test-retest reliability ({ICC}, ≥.97). Only the minimal detectable changes of the {UE}-{FM} (8\% of the highest possible score) and the {ARAT} (6\%) were satisfactory.
            
            
              Limitations
              The sample size was too small to conduct data analysis according to type or severity of stroke. In addition, the timed component of the Wolf Motor Function Test was not used in this study.
            
            
              Conclusions
              All 4 measures showed sufficient validity, responsiveness, and reliability in participants with stroke. The {UE}-{FM} for assessing impairment and the {ARAT} for assessing disability had satisfactory minimal detectable changes, supporting their utility in clinical settings.},

An essential first step is to agree on definitions of sensorimotor recovery and on measures consistent with these definitions. Such standardization would allow pooling of participant data across studies and institutions aiding meta-analyses of completed trials, more detailed exploration of recovery profiles of our patients and the generation of new hypotheses. Here, we present the results of a consensus meeting about measurement standards and patient characteristics that we suggest should be collected in all future stroke recovery trials. Recommendations are made considering time post stroke and are aligned with the international classification of functioning and disability. A strong case is made for addition of kinematic and kinetic movement quantification. Further work is being undertaken by our group to form consensus on clinical predictors and pre-stroke clinical data that should be collected, as well as recommendations for additional outcome measurement tools. To improve stroke recovery trials, we urge the research community to consider adopting our recommendations in their trial design.},

We found that visual memory and verbal memory were better predicted by {FC}, whereas visual and motor impairments were better predicted by lesion topography. Attention and language deficits were well predicted by both. Next, we identified a general pattern of physiological network dysfunction consisting of decrease of interhemispheric integration and intrahemispheric segregation, which strongly related to behavioral impairment in multiple domains. Network-specific patterns of dysfunction predicted specific behavioral deficits, and loss of interhemispheric communication across a set of regions was associated with impairment across multiple behavioral domains.

In addition, when exon 14 encoding the Aβ sequence was flanked by

{OBJECTIVE}: To review the neurological aspects of {SARS}-cov2 and other coronavirus, including transmission pathways, mechanisms of invasion into the nervous system, and mechanisms of neurological disease.
{METHODS}: We conducted a systematic review of articles in {PubMed}, {SCOPUS} and {EMBASE} data bases. Reviewed evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis, neuro-invasion, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré, {ADEM}, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease.
{RESULTS}: A total 67 studies were included in the final analysis of experimental studies, case reports, series of cases, cohort studies, and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of {SARS}- {CoV}-2 and other human coronavirus infections. The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 receptor is expressed in the nervous system. Common reported symptoms included hyposmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness. Encephalitis, demyelination, neuropathy, and stroke have been associated with {COVID}-19. Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed. Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill {COVID}-19 patients.
{CONCLUSION}: An increasing number of reports of {COVID}-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro-invasion as a reasonable concern that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is a new neuropathogen. How it may cause acute and chronic neurologic disorders needs to be clarified in future research.},

The purpose of this article is to review the spectrum of the various neurological manifestations and underlying associated pathophysiology in {COVID}-19 patients. Method: We conducted a review of the various case reports and retrospective clinical studies published on the neurological manifestations, associated literature, and related pathophysiology of {COVID}-19 using {PUBMED} and subsequent proceedings. A total of 118 articles were thoroughly reviewed in order to highlight the plausible spectrum of neurological manifestations of {COVID} 19. Every article was either based on descriptive analysis, clinical scenarios, correspondence, and editorials emphasizing the neurological manifestations either directly or indirectly. We then tried to highlight the significant plausible manifestations and complications that could be related to the pandemic. With little known about the dynamics and the presentation spectrum of the virus apart from the respiratory symptoms, this area needs further consideration. Conclusion: The neurological manifestations associated with {COVID}-19 such as Encephalitis, Meningitis, acute cerebrovascular disease, and Guillain Barré Syndrome ({GBS}) are of great concern. But in the presence of life-threatening abnormal vitals in severely ill {COVID}-19 patients, these are not usually underscored. There is a need to diagnose these manifestations at the earliest to limit long term sequelae. Much research is needed to explore the role of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in causing these neurological manifestations by isolating it either from cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissues of the deceased on autopsy. We also recommend exploring the risk factors that lead to the development of these neurological manifestations.},

	abstract = {Neurological disorders caused by neuroviral infections are an obvious pathogenic manifestation. However, non-neurotropic viruses or peripheral viral infections pose a considerable challenge as their neuropathological manifestations do not emerge because of primary infection. Their secondary or bystander pathologies develop much later, like a syndrome, during and after the recovery of patients from the primary disease. Massive inflammation caused by peripheral viral infections can trigger multiple neurological anomalies. These neurological damages may range from a general cognitive and motor dysfunction up to a wide spectrum of {CNS} anomalies, such as Acute Necrotizing Hemorrhagic Encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Encephalitis, Meningitis, anxiety, and other audio-visual disabilities. Peripheral viruses like Measles virus, Enteroviruses, Influenza viruses ({HIN}1 series), {SARS}-{CoV}-1, {MERS}-{CoV}, and, recently, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 are reported to cause various neurological manifestations in patients and are proven to be neuropathogenic even in cellular and animal model systems. This review presents a comprehensive picture of {CNS} susceptibilities toward these peripheral viral infections and explains some common underlying themes of their neuropathology in the human brain.},

The history of past human coronavirus outbreaks resulting in similar health emergencies suggests there will be a substantial prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) among {COVID}-19 survivors. To prepare neuropsychologists for the difficult task of differentiating {PTSD}-related from neuropathology-related deficits in the oncoming wave of {COVID}-19 survivors, we integrate research across a spectrum of related areas.Methods: Several areas of literature were reviewed: psychiatric, neurologic, and neuropathological outcomes of {SARS} and {MERS} patients; neurological outcomes in {COVID}-19 survivors; {PTSD} associated with procedures common to {COVID}-19 patients; and differentiating neuropsychological deficits due to {PTSD} from those due to acquired brain injuries in other patient groups.Conclusions: Heightened risk of {PTSD} occurred in {MERS} and {SARS} survivors. While data concerning {COVID}-19 is lacking, {PTSD} is known to occur in patient groups who undergo similar hospital courses, including {ICU} survivors, patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated, and those that experience delirium. Research with patients who develop {PTSD} in the context of mild traumatic brain injury further suggests that {PTSD} may account for some or all of a patient's subjective cognitive complaints and neuropsychological test performance.

Methods: In our single-center cohort study, we included all consecutive adult patients, aged between 20 and 60 years old with confirmed {COVID}-19 infection. Neuropsychological assessment was performed by the same trained neuropsychologist from April, 22nd through June 16th, 2020. Patients with previous known cognitive impairment, any central nervous system or psychiatric disease were excluded. Demographic, clinical, pharmacological and laboratory data were extracted from medical records.
Results: Thirty-five patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Patients presenting headache, anosmia, dysgeusia, diarrhea and those who required oxygen therapy had lower scores in memory, attention and executive function subtests as compared to asymptomatic patients. Patients with headache and clinical hypoxia scored lower in the global Cognitive Index (P ​= ​0.002, P ​= ​0.010). A T score lower than 30 was observed in memory domains, attention and semantic fluency (2 [5.7\%]) in working memory and mental flexibility (3 [8.6\%]) and in phonetic fluency (4 [11.4\%]). Higher scores in anxiety and depression (P ​= ​0.047, P ​= ​0.008) were found in patients with cognitive complaints.
Conclusions: In our cohort of {COVID}-19 patients neurologic manifestations were frequent, including cognitive impairment. Neurological symptoms during infection, diarrhea and oxygen therapy were risk factors for neurocognitive impairment. Cognitive complaints were associated with anxiety and depression.},

Purpose To describe the neuroimaging findings (excluding ischemic infarcts) in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) infection. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study of patients evaluated from March 23, 2020, to April 27, 2020, at 16 hospitals. Inclusion criteria were (a) positive nasopharyngeal or lower respiratory tract reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays, (b) severe {COVID}-19 infection defined as a requirement for hospitalization and oxygen therapy, (c) neurologic manifestations, and (d) abnormal brain {MRI} findings. Exclusion criteria were patients with missing or noncontributory data regarding brain {MRI} or brain {MRI} showing ischemic infarcts, cerebral venous thrombosis, or chronic lesions unrelated to the current event. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher exact test. Quantitative data were compared using the Student t test or Wilcoxon test. P {\textless} .05 represented a significant difference. Results Thirty men (81\%) and seven women (19\%) met the inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 61 years ± 12 (standard deviation) (age range, 8-78 years). The most common neurologic manifestations were alteration of consciousness (27 of 37, 73\%), abnormal wakefulness when sedation was stopped (15 of 37, 41\%), confusion (12 of 37, 32\%), and agitation (seven of 37, 19\%). The most frequent {MRI} findings were signal abnormalities located in the medial temporal lobe in 16 of 37 patients (43\%; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 27\%, 59\%), nonconfluent multifocal white matter hyperintense lesions seen with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted sequences with variable enhancement, with associated hemorrhagic lesions in 11 of 37 patients (30\%; 95\% {CI}: 15\%, 45\%), and extensive and isolated white matter microhemorrhages in nine of 37 patients (24\%; 95\% {CI}: 10\%, 38\%). A majority of patients (20 of 37, 54\%) had intracerebral hemorrhagic lesions with a more severe clinical presentation and a higher admission rate in intensive care units (20 of 20 patients [100\%] vs 12 of 17 patients without hemorrhage [71\%], P = .01) and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (20 of 20 patients [100\%] vs 11 of 17 patients [65\%], P = .005). Only one patient had {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RNA} in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conclusion Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and without ischemic infarcts had a wide range of neurologic manifestations that were associated with abnormal brain {MRI} scans. Eight distinctive neuroradiologic patterns were described. © {RSNA}, 2020.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors ({ICIs}) have been changing the paradigm of cancer treatment. However, immune-related adverse effects ({irAEs}) have also increased with the exponential increase in the use of {ICIs}. {ICIs} can break up the immunologic homeostasis and reduce T-cell tolerance. Therefore, inhibition of immune checkpoint can lead to the activation of autoreactive T-cells, resulting in various {irAEs} similar to autoimmune diseases. Gastrointestinal toxicity, endocrine toxicity, and dermatologic toxicity are common side effects. Neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity are relatively rare but can be fatal. {ICI}-related gastrointestinal toxicity, dermatologic toxicity, and hypophysitis are more common with anti- {CTLA}-4 agents. {ICI}-related pulmonary toxicity, thyroid dysfunction, and myasthenia gravis are more common with {PD}-1/{PD}-L1 inhibitors. Treatment with systemic steroids is the principal strategy against {irAEs}. The use of immune-modulatory agents should be considered in case of no response to the steroid therapy. Treatment under the supervision of multidisciplinary specialists is also essential, because the symptoms and treatments of {irAEs} could involve many organs. Thus, this review focuses on the mechanism, clinical presentation, incidence, and treatment of various {irAEs}.},

	abstract = {A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain, arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or {OEF}. The {OEF} is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations in the {OEF} represent the physiological basis of signals of changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional {MRI} during a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain the {OEF} regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean hemisphere {OEF} were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission tomography and functional {MRI}. These decreases suggest the existence of an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors.},

One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function.

	abstract = {A novel approach rooted on the notion of consensus clustering, a strategy developed for community detection in complex networks, is proposed to cope with the heterogeneity that characterizes connectivity matrices in health and disease. The method can be summarized as follows: (a) define, for each node, a distance matrix for the set of subjects by comparing the connectivity pattern of that node in all pairs of subjects; (b) cluster the distance matrix for each node; (c) build the consensus network from the corresponding partitions; and (d) extract groups of subjects by finding the communities of the consensus network thus obtained. Different from the previous implementations of consensus clustering, we thus propose to use the consensus strategy to combine the information arising from the connectivity patterns of each node. The proposed approach may be seen either as an exploratory technique or as an unsupervised pretraining step to help the subsequent construction of a supervised classifier. Applications on a toy model and two real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which represents heterogeneity of a set of subjects in terms of a weighted network, the consensus matrix.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: We develop a framework for the analysis of synergy and redundancy in the pattern of information flow between subsystems of a complex network.
{METHODS}: The presence of redundancy and/or synergy in multivariate time series data renders difficulty to estimate the neat flow of information from each driver variable to a given target. We show that adopting an unnormalized definition of Granger causality, one may put in evidence redundant multiplets of variables influencing the target by maximizing the total Granger causality to a given target, over all the possible partitions of the set of driving variables. Consequently, we introduce a pairwise index of synergy which is zero when two independent sources additively influence the future state of the system, differently from previous definitions of synergy.
{RESULTS}: We report the application of the proposed approach to resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project showing that redundant pairs of regions arise mainly due to space contiguity and interhemispheric symmetry, while synergy occurs mainly between nonhomologous pairs of regions in opposite hemispheres.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Redundancy and synergy, in healthy resting brains, display characteristic patterns, revealed by the proposed approach.
{SIGNIFICANCE}: The pairwise synergy index, here introduced, maps the informational character of the system at hand into a weighted complex network: the same approach can be applied to other complex systems whose normal state corresponds to a balance between redundant and synergetic circuits.},

	abstract = {Contemporary neuroimaging methods can shed light on the basis of human neural and cognitive specializations, with important implications for neuroscience and medicine. Indeed, different {MRI} acquisitions provide different brain networks at the macroscale; whilst diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({dMRI}) provides a structural connectivity ({SC}) coincident with the bundles of parallel fibers between brain areas, functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) accounts for the variations in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent T2(*) signal, providing functional connectivity ({FC}). Understanding the precise relation between {FC} and {SC}, that is, between brain dynamics and structure, is still a challenge for neuroscience. To investigate this problem, we acquired data at rest and built the corresponding {SC} (with matrix elements corresponding to the fiber number between brain areas) to be compared with {FC} connectivity matrices obtained by three different methods: directed dependencies by an exploratory version of structural equation modeling ({eSEM}), linear correlations (C) and partial correlations ({PC}). We also considered the possibility of using lagged correlations in time series; in particular, we compared a lagged version of {eSEM} and Granger causality ({GC}). Our results were two-fold: firstly, {eSEM} performance in correlating with {SC} was comparable to those obtained from C and {PC}, but {eSEM} (not C, nor {PC}) provides information about directionality of the functional interactions. Second, interactions on a time scale much smaller than the sampling time, captured by instantaneous connectivity methods, are much more related to {SC} than slow directed influences captured by the lagged analysis. Indeed the performance in correlating with {SC} was much worse for {GC} and for the lagged version of {eSEM}. We expect these results to supply further insights to the interplay between {SC} and functional patterns, an important issue in the study of brain physiology and function.},

We focus here on brain network reorganization in relation to postural control deficits after {TBI}. We enrolled young participants who had suffered moderate to severe {TBI}, comparing them to young, typically developing control participants. {TBI} patients (but not controls) recruited prefrontal regions to interact with two separated networks: (1) a subcortical network, including parts of the motor network, basal ganglia, cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala, posterior cingulate gyrus, and precuneus; and (2) a task-positive network, involving regions of the dorsal attention system, together with dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal regions. We also found that the increased prefrontal connectivity in {TBI} patients was correlated with some postural control indices, such as the amount of body sway, whereby patients with worse balance increased their connectivity in frontal regions more strongly. The increased prefrontal connectivity found in {TBI} patients may provide the structural scaffolding for stronger cognitive control of certain behavioral functions, consistent with the observations that various motor tasks are performed less automatically following {TBI} and that more cognitive control is associated with such actions.

            Author Summary
            Using a new hierarchical atlas whose modules are relevant for both structure and function, we found increased structural and functional connectivity in prefrontal regions in {TBI} patients as compared to controls, in addition to a general pattern of overall decreased connectivity across the {TBI} brain. Although this increased prefrontal connectivity reflected interactions between brain areas when participants were at rest, the enhanced connectivity was found to be negatively correlated with active behavior such as postural control performance. Thus our findings, obtained when the brain was at rest, potentially reflect how {TBI} patients orchestrate task-related activations to support behavior in everyday life. In particular, our findings of enhanced connectivity in {TBI} might help these patients overcome deficits in cerebellar and subcortical connections, in addition to compensating for deficits when interacting with the task-positive network. Hence, it appears that greater cognitive control is exerted over certain actions in order to overcome deficits in their automatic processing.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Neural systems are comprised of interacting units, and relevant information regarding their function or malfunction can be inferred by analyzing the statistical dependencies between the activity of each unit. While correlations and mutual information are commonly used to characterize these dependencies, our objective here is to extend interactions to triplets of variables to better detect and characterize dynamic information transfer.
{APPROACH}: Our approach relies on the measure of interaction information ({II}). The sign of {II} provides information as to the extent to which the interaction of variables in triplets is redundant (R) or synergetic (S). Three variables are said to be redundant when a third variable, say Z, added to a pair of variables (X, Y), diminishes the information shared between X and Y. Similarly, the interaction in the triplet is said to be synergetic when conditioning on Z enhances the information shared between X and Y with respect to the unconditioned state. Here, based on this approach, we calculated the R and S status for triplets of electrophysiological data recorded from drug-resistant patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in order to study the spatial organization and dynamics of R and S close to the epileptogenic zone (the area responsible for seizure propagation).
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: In terms of spatial organization, our results show that R matched the epileptogenic zone while S was distributed more in the surrounding area. In relation to dynamics, R made the largest contribution to high frequency bands (14-100 Hz), while S was expressed more strongly at lower frequencies (1-7 Hz). Thus, applying {II} to such clinical data reveals new aspects of epileptogenic structure in terms of the nature (redundancy versus synergy) and dynamics (fast versus slow rhythms) of the interactions.
{SIGNIFICANCE}: We expect this methodology, robust and simple, can reveal new aspects beyond pair-interactions in networks of interacting units in other setups with multi-recording data sets (and thus, not necessarily in epilepsy, the pathology we have approached here).},

            Accumulating neuroimaging evidence shows that age estimation obtained from brain connectomics reflects the level of brain maturation along with neural development. It is well known that autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) alters neurodevelopmental trajectories of brain connectomics, but the precise relationship between chronological age ({ChA}) and brain connectome age ({BCA}) during development in {ASD} has not been addressed. This study uses neuroimaging data collected from 50 individuals with {ASD} and 47 age- and gender-matched typically developing controls ({TDCs}; age range: 5–18 years). Both functional and structural connectomics were assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange repository. For each participant, {BCA} was estimated from structure–function connectomics through linear support vector regression. We found that {BCA} matched well with {ChA} in {TDC} children and adolescents, but not in {ASD}. In particular, our findings revealed that individuals with {ASD} exhibited accelerated brain maturation in youth, followed by a delay of brain development starting at preadolescence. Our results highlight the critical role of {BCA} in understanding aberrant developmental trajectories in {ASD} and provide the new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder.},

	abstract = {The resting brain dynamics self-organize into a finite number of correlated patterns known as resting-state networks ({RSNs}). It is well known that techniques such as independent component analysis can separate the brain activity at rest to provide such {RSNs}, but the specific pattern of interaction between {RSNs} is not yet fully understood. To this aim, we propose here a novel method to compute the information flow ({IF}) between different {RSNs} from resting-state magnetic resonance imaging. After hemodynamic response function blind deconvolution of all voxel signals, and under the hypothesis that {RSNs} define regions of interest, our method first uses principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality in each {RSN} to next compute {IF} (estimated here in terms of transfer entropy) between the different {RSNs} by systematically increasing k (the number of principal components used in the calculation). When k=1, this method is equivalent to computing {IF} using the average of all voxel activities in each {RSN}. For k≥1, our method calculates the k multivariate {IF} between the different {RSNs}. We find that the average {IF} among {RSNs} is dimension dependent, increasing from k=1 (i.e., the average voxel activity) up to a maximum occurring at k=5 and to finally decay to zero for k≥10. This suggests that a small number of components (close to five) is sufficient to describe the {IF} pattern between {RSNs}. Our method--addressing differences in {IF} between {RSNs} for any generic data--can be used for group comparison in health or disease. To illustrate this, we have calculated the inter-{RSN} {IF} in a data set of Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) to find that the most significant differences between {AD} and controls occurred for k=2, in addition to {AD} showing increased {IF} w.r.t.
{CONTROLS}: The spatial localization of the k=2 component, within {RSNs}, allows the characterization of {IF} differences between {AD} and controls.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is a chronically progressive neurodegenerative disease highly correlated to aging. Whether {AD} originates by targeting a localized brain area and propagates to the rest of the brain across disease-severity progression is a question with an unknown answer. Here, we aim to provide an answer to this question at the group-level by looking at differences in diffusion-tensor brain networks. In particular, making use of data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI}), four different groups were defined (all of them matched by age, sex and education level): G1 (N1 = 36, healthy control subjects, Control), G2 (N2 = 36, early mild cognitive impairment, {EMCI}), G3 (N3 = 36, late mild cognitive impairment, {LMCI}) and G4 (N4 = 36, {AD}). Diffusion-tensor brain networks were compared across three disease stages: stage I (Control vs. {EMCI}), stage {II} (Control vs. {LMCI}) and stage {III} (Control vs. {AD}). The group comparison was performed using the multivariate distance matrix regression analysis, a technique that was born in genomics and was recently proposed to handle brain functional networks, but here applied to diffusion-tensor data. The results were threefold: First, no significant differences were found in stage I. Second, significant differences were found in stage {II} in the connectivity pattern of a subnetwork strongly associated to memory function (including part of the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal pole). Third, a widespread disconnection across the entire {AD} brain was found in stage {III}, affecting more strongly the same memory subnetwork appearing in stage {II}, plus the other new subnetworks, including the default mode network, medial visual network, frontoparietal regions and striatum. Our results are consistent with a scenario where progressive alterations of connectivity arise as the disease severity increases and provide the brain areas possibly involved in such a degenerative process. Further studies applying the same strategy to longitudinal data are needed to fully confirm this scenario.},

	abstract = {Multiorgan failure ({MOF}) is a life-threating condition that affects two or more systems of organs not involved in the disorder that motivates admission to an Intensive Care Unit ({ICU}). Patients who survive {MOF} frequently present long-term functional, neurological, cognitive, and psychiatric sequelae. However, the changes to the brain that explain such symptoms remain unclear.
{OBJECTIVE}: To determine brain connectivity and cognitive functioning differences between a group of {MOF} patients six months after {ICU} discharge and healthy controls ({HC}).
{METHODS}: 22 {MOF} patients and 22 {HC} matched by age, sex, and years of education were recruited. Both groups were administered a 3T magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), including structural T1 and functional {BOLD}, as well as a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation that included tests of learning and memory, speed of information processing and attention, executive function, visual constructional abilities, and language. Voxel-based morphometry was used to analyses T1 images. For the functional data at rest, functional connectivity ({FC}) analyses were performed.
{RESULTS}: There were no significant differences in structural imaging and neuropsychological performance between groups, even though patients with {MOF} performed worse in all the cognitive tests. Functional neuroimaging in the default mode network ({DMN}) showed hyper-connectivity towards sensory-motor, cerebellum, and visual networks. {DMN} connectivity had a significant association with the severity of {MOF} during {ICU} stay and with the neuropsychological scores in tests of attention and visual constructional abilities.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In {MOF} patients without structural brain injury, {DMN} connectivity six months after {ICU} discharge is associated with {MOF} severity and neuropsychological impairment, which supports the use of resting-state functional {MRI} as a potential tool to predict the onset of long-term cognitive deficits in these patients. Similar to what occurs at the onset of other pathologies, the observed hyper-connectivity might suggest network re-adaptation following {MOF}.},

Despite these improvements, seven of the eight indices of {HRQOL} in stroke individuals remained very low over time, suggesting that the vast majority of rehabilitation gains in {HRQOL}, even when present, were extremely limited. {CONCLUSIONS} The current findings suggest a need in Latin America for mental health services after stroke, as well as other interventions designed to increase social and family support, which may thereby improve mental health.},

We report the results of a prospective 10-year longitudinal study of the incidence of {iNPH} in a northern Spanish population.
{METHODS}: In a stable population of 590,000 inhabitants served by a single neurosurgical department, we periodically asked all primary care practitioners, neurologists, and geriatricians to refer for {iNPH} screening any patient with ventricular dilation who was complaining of motor disturbances, cognitive impairment, or sphincter dysfunction.
{RESULTS}: From January 2003 to December 2012, 293 patients were referred with suspected normal-pressure hydrocephalus. In 187 patients, {iNPH} was diagnosed; 89 of these patients were classified as probable {iNPH}, and 98 were classified as possible {iNPH}. Cerebrospinal fluid diversion was performed in 152 patients, and 119 showed a good outcome. The incidence of {iNPH} was significantly greater in male patients and patients {\textgreater}60 years old and increased exponentially with age. After age 60, the standardized age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates for {iNPH}, shunt surgery for {iNPH}, and shunt-responsive {iNPH} were 13.36 cases/100,000 inhabitants/year, 10.85 cases/100,000 inhabitants/year, and 8.55 cases/100,000 inhabitants/year. No differences were detected in the response rate between probable and possible {iNPH} (80.52\% vs. 76.00\%; P = 0.497).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Even with a protocol for patient referral in place, reported {iNPH} incidence was lower than predicted, reflecting a persistent problem of underdiagnosis in our population.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous mapping of multiple behavioral domains into brain networks remains a major challenge. Here, we shed some light on this problem by employing a combination of machine learning, structural and functional brain networks at different spatial resolutions (also known as scales), together with performance scores across multiple neurobehavioral domains, including sensation, motor skills, and cognition. Provided by the Human Connectome Project, we make use of three cohorts: 640 participants for model training, 160 subjects for validation, and 200 subjects for model performance testing thus enhancing prediction generalization. Our modeling consists of two main stages, namely dimensionality reduction in brain network features at multiple scales, followed by canonical correlation analysis, which determines an optimal linear combination of connectivity features to predict multiple behavioral performance scores. To assess the differences in the predictive power of each modality, we separately applied three different strategies: structural unimodal, functional unimodal, and multimodal, that is, structural in combination with functional features of the brain network. Our results show that the multimodal association outperforms any of the unimodal analyses. Then, to answer which human brain structures were most involved in predicting multiple behavioral scores, we simulated different synthetic scenarios in which in each case we completely deleted a brain structure or a complete resting state network, and recalculated performance in its absence. In deletions, we found critical structures to affect performance when predicting single behavioral domains, but this occurred in a lesser manner for prediction of multi-domain behavior. Overall, our results confirm that although there are synergistic contributions between brain structure and function that enhance behavioral prediction, brain networks may also be mutually redundant in predicting multidomain behavior, such that even after deletion of a structure, the connectivity of the others can compensate for its lack in predicting behavior.},

In a Cox regression analysis, biological age was significantly more highly associated with death than chronological age. The average increase in the frailty index (i.e. the average accumulation of deficits) amongst those with no cognitive impairment was 3 per cent per year.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The frailty index is a sensitive predictor of survival. As the index includes items not traditionally related to adverse health outcomes, the finding is compatible with a view of frailty as the failure to integrate the complex responses required to maintain function.},

	abstract = {Current sampling protocols of neoplasms along the digestive tract and in the urinary bladder have to be updated, as they do not respond to the necessities of modern personalized medicine. We show here that an adapted version of multisite tumor sampling ({MSTS}) is a sustainable model to overcome current deficiencies in digestive and bladder tumors when they are large enough so as to make unaffordable a total sampling. The new method is based on the divide-and-conquer algorithm and includes a slight modification of the {MSTS}, which proved to be useful very recently in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. This in silico analysis confirms the usefulness of {MSTS} for detecting intratumor heterogeneity ({ITH}) in tumors arising in hollow viscera. However, {MSTS} does not seem to improve routine traditional sampling in detecting tumor budding, extramural venous invasion, and perineural invasion. We conclude that (1) {MSTS} is the best method for tumor sampling to detect {ITH} balancing high performance and sustainable cost, (2) {MSTS} must be adapted to tumor shape and tumor location for an optimal performance.},

	volume = {46},
	issn = {1095-9572},
	abstract = {Aging is associated with significant white matter deterioration and this deterioration is assumed to be at least partly a consequence of myelin degeneration. The present study investigated specific predictions of the myelodegeneration hypothesis using diffusion tensor tractography. This technique has several advantages over other methods of assessing white matter architecture, including the possibility of isolating individual white matter tracts and measuring effects along the whole extent of each tract. The study yielded three main findings. First, age-related white matter deficits increased gradually from posterior to anterior segments within specific fiber tracts traversing frontal and parietal, but not temporal cortex. This pattern inverts the sequence of myelination during childhood and early development observed in previous studies and lends support to a "last-in-first-out" theory of the white matter health across the lifespan. Second, both the effects of aging on white matter and their impact on cognitive performance were stronger for radial diffusivity ({RD}) than for axial diffusivity ({AD}). Given that {RD} has previously been shown to be more sensitive to myelin integrity than {AD}, this second finding is also consistent with the myelodegeneration hypothesis. Finally, the effects of aging on select white matter tracts were associated with age difference in specific cognitive functions. Specifically, {FA} in anterior tracts was shown to be primarily associated with executive tasks and {FA} in posterior tracts mainly associated with visual memory tasks. Furthermore, these correlations were mirrored in {RD}, but not {AD}, suggesting that {RD} is more sensitive to age-related changes in cognition. Taken together, the results help to clarify how age-related white matter decline impairs cognitive performance.},

	abstract = {This paper broadly reviews the study of mild traumatic brain injury ({mTBI}), across the spectrum of neuroimaging modalities. Among the range of imaging methods, however, magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) is unique in its applicability to studying both structure and function. Thus we additionally performed meta-analyses of {MRI} results to examine 1) the issue of anatomical variability and consistency for functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) findings, 2) the analogous issue of anatomical consistency for white-matter findings, and 3) the importance of accounting for the time post injury in diffusion weighted imaging reports. As we discuss, the human neuroimaging literature consists of both small and large studies spanning acute to chronic time points that have examined both structural and functional changes with {mTBI}, using virtually every available medical imaging modality. Two key commonalities have been used across the majority of imaging studies. The first is the comparison between {mTBI} and control populations. The second is the attempt to link imaging results with neuropsychological assessments. Our {fMRI} meta-analysis demonstrates a frontal vulnerability to {mTBI}, demonstrated by decreased signal in prefrontal cortex compared to controls. This vulnerability is further highlighted by examining the frequency of reported {mTBI} white matter anisotropy, in which we show a strong anterior-to-posterior gradient (with anterior regions being more frequently reported in {mTBI}). Our final {DTI} meta-analysis examines a debated topic arising from inconsistent anisotropy findings across studies. Our results support the hypothesis that acute {mTBI} is associated with elevated anisotropy values and chronic {mTBI} complaints are correlated with depressed anisotropy. Thus, this review and set of meta-analyses demonstrate several important points about the ongoing use of neuroimaging to understand the functional and structural changes that occur throughout the time course of {mTBI} recovery. Based on the complexity of {mTBI}, however, much more work in this area is required to characterize injury mechanisms and recovery factors and to achieve clinically-relevant capabilities for diagnosis.},

The present study used tensor-based morphometry and neuropsychological testing to examine brain volume loss in 17 traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) patients and 13 controls over a 4-year period. Patients were scanned at 2 months, 1 year, and 4 years post-injury. High-dimensional warping procedures were used to create change maps of each subject's brain for each of the two intervals. {TBI} patients experienced volume loss in both cortical areas and white matter regions during the first interval. We also observed continuing volume loss in extensive regions of white matter during the second interval. Neuropsychological correlations indicated that cognitive tasks were associated with subsequent volume loss in task-relevant regions. The extensive volume loss in brain white matter observed well beyond the first year post-injury suggests that the injured brain remains malleable for an extended period, and the neuropsychological relationships suggest that this volume loss may be associated with subtle cognitive improvements.},

Such behavioral switching can occur either retroactively based on error feedback or proactively by detecting a contextual cue. Recent imaging and electrophysiological data in humans and monkeys support the view that the frontal cortical areas play executive roles in behavioral switching. The anterior cingulate cortex acts retroactively and the pre-supplementary motor area acts proactively to enable behavioral switching. The lateral prefrontal cortex reconfigures cognitive processes constituting the switched behavior. The subthalamic nucleus and the striatum in the basal ganglia mediate these cortical signals to achieve behavioral switching. We discuss how breaking a routine to allow more adaptive behavior requires a fine-tuned recruitment of the frontal cortical-basal ganglia neural network.},

	abstract = {The basal ganglia comprise several nuclei in the forebrain, diencephalon, and midbrain thought to play a significant role in the control of posture and movement. It is well recognized that people with degenerative diseases of the basal ganglia suffer from rigidly held abnormal body postures, slowing of movement, involuntary movements, or a combination of these a abnormalities. However, it has not been agreed just what the basal ganglia contribute to normal movement. Recent advances in knowledge of the basal ganglia circuitry, activity of basal ganglia neurons during movement, and the effect of basal ganglia lesions have led to a new hypothesis of basal ganglia function. The hypothesis states that the basal ganglia do not generate movements. Instead, when voluntary movement is generated by cerebral cortical and cerebellar mechanisms, the basal ganglia act broadly to inhibit competing motor mechanisms that would otherwise interfere with the desired movement. Simultaneously, inhibition is removed focally from the desired motor mechanisms to allow that movement to proceed. Inability to inhibit competing motor programs results in slow movements, abnormal postures and involuntary muscle activity.},

	shorttitle = {Basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits},
	abstract = {The central theme of the "segregated circuits" hypothesis is that structural convergence and functional integration occurs within, rather than between, each of the identified circuits. Admittedly, the anatomical evidence upon which this scheme is based remains incomplete. The hypothesis continues to be predicated largely on comparisons of anterograde and retrograde labeling studies carried out in different sets of animals. Only in the case of the "motor" circuit has evidence for the continuity of the loop been demonstrated directly in individual subjects; for the other circuits, such continuity is inferred from comparisons of data on different components of each circuit obtained in separate experiments. Because of the marked compression of pathways leading from cortex through basal ganglia to thalamus, comparisons of projection topography across experimental subjects may be hazardous. Definitive tests of the hypothesis of maintained segregation await additional double- and multiple-label tract-tracing experiments wherein the continuity of one circuit, or the segregation of adjacent circuits, can be examined directly in individual subjects. It is worthy of note, however, that the few studies to date that have employed this methodology have generated results consistent with the segregated circuits hypothesis. Moreover, single cell recordings in behaving animals have shown striking preservation of functional specificity at the level of individual neurons throughout the "motor" and "oculomotor" circuits. It is difficult to imagine how such functional specificity could be maintained in the absence of strict topographic specificity within the sequential projections that comprise these two circuits. This is not to say, however, that we expect the internal structure of functional channels (e.g., the "arm" channel within the "motor" circuit) to have cable-like, point-to-point topography. When the grain of analysis is sufficiently fine, anatomical studies have shown repeatedly that the terminal fields of internuclear projections (e.g., to striatum, pallidum, nigra, thalamus, etc.) often appear patchy and highly divergent, suggesting that neighboring groups of projection cells tend to influence interdigitating clusters of postsynaptic neurons. While more intricate and complex than simple point-to-point topography, however, this type arrangement should also be capable of maintaining functional specificity. As discussed briefly above, it is not yet clear to what extent the inputs to the "motor" circuit from the different precentral motor fields (e.g., {MC}, {SMA}, {APA}) are integrated in their passage through the circuit. It now appears that at the level of the putamen such inputs remain segregated.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

In the past, quantitative volumetric analysis of these changes was carried out by manually tracing specific regions of interest. In contrast, voxel based morphometry ({VBM}) is a fully automated technique that allows examination of the whole brain on a voxel by voxel basis.
{OBJECTIVE}: To use {VBM} to evaluate changes in grey matter concentration following traumatic brain injury.
{METHODS}: Nine patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (ranging from mild to severe) about one year previously were compared with nine age and sex matched healthy volunteers. T1 weighted three dimensional {MRI} images were acquired and then analysed with statistical parametric mapping software ({SPM}2). The patients with traumatic brain injury also completed cognitive testing to determine whether regional grey matter concentration correlated with a measure of attention and initial injury severity.
{RESULTS}: Compared with controls, the brain injured patients had decreased grey matter concentration in multiple brain regions including frontal and temporal cortices, cingulate gyrus, subcortical grey matter, and the cerebellum. Decreased grey matter concentration correlated with lower scores on tests of attention and lower Glasgow coma scale scores.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Using {VBM}, regions of decreased grey matter concentration were observed in subjects with traumatic brain injury compared with well matched controls. In the brain injured patients, there was a relation between grey matter concentration and attentional ability.},

Additionally, studies in animal models have demonstrated the correlation of {DTI} findings and {TBI} pathology. One hundred articles met the inclusion criteria for this quantitative literature review. Despite significant variability in sample characteristics, technical aspects of imaging, and analysis approaches, the consensus is that {DTI} effectively differentiates patients with {TBI} and controls, regardless of the severity and timeframe following injury. Furthermore, many have established a relationship between {DTI} measures and {TBI} outcomes. However, the heterogeneity of specific outcome measures used limits interpretation of the literature. Similarly, few longitudinal studies have been performed, limiting inferences regarding the long-term predictive utility of {DTI}. Larger longitudinal studies, using standardized imaging, analysis approaches, and outcome measures will help realize the promise of {DTI} as a prognostic tool in the care of patients with {TBI}.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) is a leading cause of death in the young population and long-term disability in relation to pervasive cognitive-behavioural disturbances that follow frontal lobe damage. To date, emphasis has been placed primarily on the clinical correlates of frontal cortex damage, whilst identification of the contribution of subjacent white matter lesion is less clear. Our poor understanding of white matter pathology in {TBI} is primarily due to the low sensitivity of conventional neuroimaging to identify pathological changes in less severe traumatic injury and the lack of methods to localise white matter pathology onto individual frontal lobe connections. In this paper we focus on the potential contribution of diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) to {TBI}. Our review of the current literature supports the conclusion that {DTI} is particularly sensitive to changes in the microstructure of frontal white matter, thus providing a valuable biomarker of the severity of traumatic injury and prognostic indicator of recovery of function. Furthermore we propose an atlas approach to {TBI} to map white matter lesions onto individual tracts. In the cases presented here we showed a direct correspondence between the clinical manifestations of the patients and the damage to specific white matter tracts. We are confident that in the near future the application of {DTI} to {TBI} will improve our understanding of the complex and heterogeneous clinical symptomatology which follows a {TBI}, especially mild and moderate head injury, which still represents 70-80\% of all clinical population.},

	abstract = {The distribution and extent of traumatic lesions were prospectively evaluated with {MR} imaging in 40 patients with closed head injuries. Primary intraaxial lesions were classified according to their distinctive topographical distribution within the brain and were of four main types: (1) diffuse axonal injury (48.2\%), (2) cortical contusion (43.7\%), (3) subcortical gray-matter injury (4.5\%), and (4) primary brainstem injury (3.6\%). Diffuse axonal injury most commonly involved the white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes, the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, and the corona radiata. Cortical contusions most frequently involved the inferior, lateral, and anterior aspects of the frontal and temporal lobes. Primary brainstem lesions were most commonly seen in the dorsolateral aspects of the rostral brainstem. The pattern and distribution of primary lesions seen by {MR} were compared with those expected from previous pathologic studies and found to be quite similar. Our data and review of the literature would also indicate that {MR} detects a more complete spectrum of traumatic lesions than does {CT}. Secondary forms of injury (territorial arterial infarction, pressure necrosis from increased intracranial pressure, cerebral herniation, secondary brainstem injury) were also visible by {MR} in some cases. The level of consciousness was most impaired in patients with primary brainstem injury, followed by those with widespread diffuse axonal injury and subcortical gray-matter injury. The best {MR} imaging planes, pulse sequences, and imaging strategies for evaluating and classifying traumatic lesions were evaluated, and the mechanisms by which traumatic stresses result in injury were reviewed. {MR} was found to be superior to {CT} and to be very effective in the detection of traumatic head lesions and some secondary forms of injury. While T2-weighted images were most useful for lesion detection, T1-weighted images proved to be most useful for anatomic localization and classification.},

Independently, we extract the major covarying networks in the resting brain, as imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 36 subjects at rest. The sets of major brain networks, and their decompositions into subnetworks, show close correspondence between the independent analyses of resting and activation brain dynamics.

	abstract = {We study both analytically and numerically the effect of presynaptic noise on the transmission of information in attractor neural networks. The noise occurs on a very short timescale compared to that for the neuron dynamics and it produces short-time synaptic depression. This is inspired in recent neurobiological findings that show that synaptic strength may either increase or decrease on a short timescale depending on presynaptic activity. We thus describe a mechanism by which fast presynaptic noise enhances the neural network sensitivity to an external stimulus. The reason is that, in general, presynaptic noise induces nonequilibrium behavior and, consequently, the space of fixed points is qualitatively modified in such a way that the system can easily escape from the attractor. As a result, the model shows, in addition to pattern recognition, class identification and categorization, which may be relevant to the understanding of some of the brain complex tasks.},

	abstract = {Like many cancers, an early diagnosis of melanoma is fundamental to ensure a good prognosis, although an important proportion of stage I-{II} patients may still develop metastasis during follow-up. The aim of this work was to discover serum biomarkers in patients diagnosed with primary melanoma that identify those at a high risk of developing metastasis during the follow-up period. Proteomic and mass spectrophotometry analysis was performed on serum obtained from patients who developed metastasis during the first years after surgery for primary tumors and compared with that from patients who remained disease-free for more than 10 years after surgery. Five proteins were selected for validation as prognostic factors in 348 melanoma patients and 100 controls by {ELISA}: serum amyloid A and clusterin; immune system proteins; the cell adhesion molecules plakoglobin and vitronectin and the antimicrobial protein dermcidin. Compared to healthy controls, melanoma patients have high serum levels of these proteins at the moment of melanoma diagnosis, although the specific values were not related to the histopathological stage of the tumors. However, an analysis based on classification together with multivariate statistics showed that tumor stage, vitronectin and dermcidin levels were associated with the metastatic progression of patients with early-stage melanoma. Although melanoma patients have increased serum dermcidin levels, the {REPTree} classifier showed that levels of dermcidin {\textless}2.98 μg/ml predict metastasis in {AJCC} stage {II} patients. These data suggest that vitronectin and dermcidin are potent biomarkers of prognosis, which may help to improve the personalized medical care of melanoma patients and their survival.},

	abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest ({ROIs}). Using a dataset of 40 {MRI} scans we manually identified 34 cortical {ROIs} in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label {ROIs}. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients ({ICC}), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of {ROIs}. When compared with the manual {ROIs}, the automated {ROIs} were highly accurate, with an average {ICC} of 0.835 across all of the {ROIs}, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of {ROIs}. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which {MRI}-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

We introduce a new, {MATLAB} based toolbox for the {SPM}2 software package which enables the integration of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps and results of functional imaging studies. The toolbox includes the functionality for the construction of summary maps combining probability of several cortical areas by finding the most probable assignment of each voxel to one of these areas. Its main feature is to provide several measures defining the degree of correspondence between architectonic areas and functional foci. The software, together with the presently available probability maps, is available as open source software to the neuroimaging community.

In the present study, the {TD} system and its 3-D database of labels for the 1988 Talairach atlas were tested for labeling of functional activation foci. {TD} system labels were compared with author-designated labels of activation coordinates from over 250 published functional brain-mapping studies and with manual atlas-derived labels from an expert group using a subset of these activation coordinates. Automated labeling by the {TD} system compared well with authors' labels, with a 70\% or greater label match averaged over all locations. Author-label matching improved to greater than 90\% within a search range of +/-5 mm for most sites. An adaptive grey matter ({GM}) range-search utility was evaluated using individual activations from the M1 mouth region (30 subjects, 52 sites). It provided an 87\% label match to Brodmann area labels ({BA} 4 \& {BA} 6) within a search range of +/-5 mm. Using the adaptive {GM} range search, the {TD} system's overall match with authors' labels (90\%) was better than that of the expert group (80\%). When used in concert with authors' deeper knowledge of an experiment, the {TD} system provides consistent and comprehensive labels for brain activation foci. Additional suggested applications of the {TD} system include interactive labeling, anatomical grouping of activation foci, lesion-deficit analysis, and neuroanatomy education.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: In subjects performing no specific cognitive task ("resting state"), time courses of voxels within functionally connected regions of the brain have high cross-correlation coefficients ("functional connectivity"). The purpose of this study was to measure the contributions of low frequencies and physiological noise to cross-correlation maps.
{METHODS}: In four healthy volunteers, task-activation functional {MR} imaging and resting-state data were acquired. We obtained four contiguous slice locations in the "resting state" with a high sampling rate. Regions of interest consisting of four contiguous voxels were selected. The correlation coefficient for the averaged time course and every other voxel in the four slices was calculated and separated into its component frequency contributions. We calculated the relative amounts of the spectrum that were in the low-frequency (0 to 0.1 Hz), the respiratory-frequency (0.1 to 0.5 Hz), and cardiac-frequency range (0.6 to 1.2 Hz).
{RESULTS}: For each volunteer, resting-state maps that resembled task-activation maps were obtained. For the auditory and visual cortices, the correlation coefficient depended almost exclusively on low frequencies ({\textless}0.1 Hz). For all cortical regions studied, low-frequency fluctuations contributed more than 90\% of the correlation coefficient. Physiological (respiratory and cardiac) noise sources contributed less than 10\% to any functional connectivity {MR} imaging map. In blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid, physiological noise contributed more to the correlation coefficient.
{CONCLUSION}: Functional connectivity in the auditory, visual, and sensorimotor cortices is characterized predominantly by frequencies slower than those in the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In functionally connected regions, these low frequencies are characterized by a high degree of temporal coherence.},

	abstract = {Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain function from {fMRI} data frequently require the specification of regions of interests ({ROIs}). Several analyses have relied on atlases derived from anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries to specify these {ROIs}, yet the suitability of atlases for resting state functional connectivity ({FC}) studies has yet to be established. This article introduces a data-driven method for generating an {ROI} atlas by parcellating whole brain resting-state {fMRI} data into spatially coherent regions of homogeneous {FC}. Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number of clusters. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation atlas against four {ROI} atlases (Talairach and Tournoux, Harvard-Oxford, Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical Labeling) and a random parcellation approach. The evaluated anatomical atlases exhibit poor {ROI} homogeneity and do not accurately reproduce {FC} patterns present at the voxel scale. In general, the proposed functional and random parcellations perform equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. {ROI} size and hence the number of {ROIs} in a parcellation had the greatest impact on their suitability for {FC} analysis. With 200 or fewer {ROIs}, the resulting parcellations consist of {ROIs} with anatomic homology, and thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation results containing higher numbers of {ROIs} (600 or 1,000) most accurately represent {FC} patterns present at the voxel scale and are preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for accuracy. The resulting atlases and clustering software have been made publicly available at: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/cluster\_roi/.},

	abstract = {Aging is characterized by brain structural changes that may compromise motor functions. In the context of postural control, white matter integrity is crucial for the efficient transfer of visual, proprioceptive and vestibular feedback in the brain. To determine the role of age-related white matter decline as a function of the sensory feedback necessary to correct posture, we acquired diffusion weighted images in young and old subjects. A force platform was used to measure changes in body posture under conditions of compromised proprioceptive and/or visual feedback. In the young group, no significant brain structure-balance relations were found. In the elderly however, the integrity of a cluster in the frontal forceps explained 21\% of the variance in postural control when proprioceptive information was compromised. Additionally, when only the vestibular system supplied reliable information, the occipital forceps was the best predictor of balance performance (42\%). Age-related white matter decline may thus be predictive of balance performance in the elderly when sensory systems start to degrade.},

The aim of this study was to assess deficits in sensory organization and postural ability in a young group of {TBI} patients versus controls by using quantitative force-platform recordings, and to test whether balance deficits are related to variation in structural properties of the motor and sensory white matter pathways. Twelve patients with {TBI} and 14 controls (aged 8-20 years) performed the Sensory Organisation Test ({SOT}) protocol of the {EquiTest} (Neurocom). All participants were scanned using Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI}) along with standard anatomical scans. Quantitative comparisons of {DTI} parameters (fractional anisotropy, axial and radial diffusivity) between {TBI} patients and controls were performed. Correlations between {DTI} parameters and {SOT} balance scores were determined. Findings revealed that the {TBI} group scored generally lower than the control group on the {SOT}, indicative of deficits in postural control. In the {TBI} group, reductions in fractional anisotropy were noted in the cerebellum, posterior thalamic radiation, and corticospinal tract. Degree of white matter deterioration was highly correlated with balance deficits. This study supports the view that {DTI} is a valuable tool for assessing the integrity of white matter structures and for selectively predicting functional motor deficits in {TBI} patients.},

The exact relationship between structure and function, however, might not be straightforward. In this review we aim to examine how our understanding of the relationship between structure and function in the 'resting' brain has advanced over the last several years. We discuss eight articles that directly compare resting-state functional connectivity with structural connectivity and three clinical case studies of patients with limited white matter connections between the cerebral hemispheres. All studies examined show largely convergent results: the strength of resting-state functional connectivity is positively correlated with structural connectivity strength. However, functional connectivity is also observed between regions where there is little or no structural connectivity, which most likely indicates functional correlations mediated by indirect structural connections (i.e. via a third region). As the methodologies for measuring structural and functional connectivity continue to improve and their complementary strengths are applied in parallel, we can expect important advances in our diagnostic and prognostic capacities in diseases like Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.},

Young patients with moderate to severe {TBI} and typically developing ({TD}) subjects participated in balance training using {PC}-based portable balancers with storage of training data and real-time visual feedback. An additional control group of {TD} subjects did not attend balance training. Mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were determined with diffusion {MRI} scans and were acquired before, during (4 weeks) and at completion of training (8 weeks) together with balance assessments on the {EquiTest}® System ({NeuroCom}) which included the Sensory Organization Test, Rhythmic Weight Shift and Limits of Stability protocols. Following training, {TBI} patients showed significant improvements on all {EquiTest} protocols, as well as a significant increase in mean diffusivity in the inferior cerebellar peduncle. Moreover, in both training groups, diffusion metrics in the cerebellum and/or cerebellar peduncles at baseline were predictive of the amount of performance increase after training. Finally, amount of training-induced improvement on the Rhythmic Weight Shift test in {TBI} patients was positively correlated with amount of change in fractional anisotropy in the inferior cerebellar peduncle. This suggests that training-induced plastic changes in balance control are associated with alterations in the cerebellar white matter microstructure in {TBI} patients.},

{OBJECTIVE}: To study functional magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in signal amplitude and brain connectivity at rest and their relationship to cognitive outcome in patients with chronic and severe traumatic axonal injury.
{DESIGN}: Observational study.
{SETTING}: University of Barcelona and Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Barcelona, and Institut Guttmann-Neurorehabilitation Hospital, Badalona, Spain.
{PARTICIPANTS}: Twenty patients with traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) were studied, along with 17 matched healthy volunteers.
{INTERVENTIONS}: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired. After exploring group differences in amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations ({ALFF}), we studied functional connectivity within the default mode network ({DMN}) by means of independent component analysis, followed by a dual regression approach and seed-based connectivity analyses. Finally, we performed probabilistic tractography between the frontal and posterior nodes of the {DMN}.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Signal amplitude and functional connectivity during the resting state, tractography related to {DMN}, and the association between signal amplitudes and cognitive outcome.
{RESULTS}: Patients had greater {ALFF} in frontal regions, which was correlated with cognitive performance. Within the {DMN}, patients showed increased connectivity in the frontal lobes. Seed-based connectivity analyses revealed augmented connectivity within surrounding areas of the frontal and left parietal nodes of the {DMN}. Fractional anisotropy of the cingulate tract was correlated with increased connectivity of the frontal node of the {DMN} in patients with {TBI}.
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: Increased {ALFF} is related to better cognitive performance in chronic {TBI}. The loss of structural connectivity produced by damage to the cingulum tract explained the compensatory increases in functional connectivity within the frontal node of the {DMN}.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: This study was approved by the institutional review board and complied with {HIPAA} regulations. Twenty-three patients with {MTBI} who had posttraumatic symptoms shortly after injury ({\textless}2 months) and 18 age-matched healthy control subjects were included in this study. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 3 T to characterize the {DMN} by using {ICA} methods, including a single-participant {ICA} on the basis of a comprehensive template from core seeds in the posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}) and medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) nodes. {ICA} z images of {DMN} components were compared between the two groups and correlated with neurocognitive tests and clinical performance in patients by using Pearson and Spearman rank correlation.
{RESULTS}: When compared with the control subjects, there was significantly reduced connectivity in the {PCC} and parietal regions and increased frontal connectivity around the {MPFC} in patients with {MTBI} (P {\textless} .01). These frontoposterior opposing changes within the {DMN} were significantly correlated (r = -0.44, P = .03). The reduced posterior connectivity correlated positively with neurocognitive dysfunction (eg, cognitive flexibility), while the increased frontal connectivity correlated negatively with posttraumatic symptoms (ie, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and postconcussion syndrome).
{CONCLUSION}: These results showed abnormal {DMN} connectivity patterns in patients with {MTBI}, which may provide insight into how neuronal communication and information integration are disrupted among {DMN} key structures after mild head injury.},

	abstract = {{OBJECT}: Traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) is one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide. One mechanism by which blunt head trauma may disrupt normal cognition and behavior is through alteration of functional connectivity between brain regions. In this pilot study, the authors applied a rapid automated resting state magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) imaging technique suitable for routine clinical use to test the hypothesis that there is decreased functional connectivity in patients with {TBI} compared with matched controls, even in cases of mild {TBI}. Furthermore, they posit that these abnormal reductions in {MEG} functional connectivity can be detected even in {TBI} patients without specific evidence of traumatic lesions on 3-T {MR} images. Finally, they hypothesize that the reductions of functional connectivity can improve over time across serial {MEG} scans during recovery from {TBI}.
{METHODS}: Magnetoencephalography maps of functional connectivity in the alpha (8- to 12-Hz) band from 21 patients who sustained a {TBI} were compared with those from 18 age- and sex-matched controls. Regions of altered functional connectivity in each patient were detected in automated fashion through atlas-based registration to the control database. The extent of reduced functional connectivity in the patient group was tested for correlations with clinical characteristics of the injury as well as with findings on 3-T {MRI}. Finally, the authors compared initial connectivity maps with 2-year follow-up functional connectivity in a subgroup of 5 patients with {TBI}.
{RESULTS}: Fourteen male and 7 female patients (17-53 years old, median 29 years) were enrolled. By Glasgow Coma Scale ({GCS}) criteria, 11 patients had mild, 1 had moderate, and 3 had severe {TBI}, and 6 had no {GCS} score recorded. On 3-T {MRI}, 16 patients had abnormal findings attributable to the trauma and 5 had findings in the normal range. As a group, the patients with {TBI} had significantly lower functional connectivity than controls (p {\textless} 0.01). Three of the 5 patients with normal findings on 3-T {MRI} showed regions of abnormally reduced {MEG} functional connectivity. No significant correlations were seen between extent of functional disconnection and injury severity or posttraumatic symptoms (p {\textgreater} 0.05). In the subgroup undergoing 2-year follow-up, the second {MEG} scan demonstrated a significantly lower percentage of voxels with decreased connectivity (p {\textless} 0.05) than the initial {MEG} scan.
{CONCLUSIONS}: A rapid automated resting-state {MEG} imaging technique demonstrates abnormally decreased functional connectivity that may persist for years after {TBI}, including cases classified as "mild" by {GCS} criteria. Disrupted {MEG} connectivity can be detected even in some patients with normal findings on 3-T {MRI}. Analysis of follow-up {MEG} scans in a subgroup of patients shows that, over time, the abnormally reduced connectivity can improve, suggesting neuroplasticity during the recovery from {TBI}. Resting state {MEG} deserves further investigation as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for {TBI}.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1113455109},
	abstract = {Efficient behavior involves the coordinated activity of large-scale brain networks, but the way in which these networks interact is uncertain. One theory is that the salience network ({SN})--which includes the anterior cingulate cortex, presupplementary motor area, and anterior insulae--regulates dynamic changes in other networks. If this is the case, then damage to the structural connectivity of the {SN} should disrupt the regulation of associated networks. To investigate this hypothesis, we studied a group of 57 patients with cognitive impairments following traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) and 25 control subjects using the stop-signal task. The pattern of brain activity associated with stop-signal task performance was studied by using functional {MRI}, and the structural integrity of network connections was quantified by using diffusion tensor imaging. Efficient inhibitory control was associated with rapid deactivation within parts of the default mode network ({DMN}), including the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. {TBI} patients showed a failure of {DMN} deactivation, which was associated with an impairment of inhibitory control. {TBI} frequently results in traumatic axonal injury, which can disconnect brain networks by damaging white matter tracts. The abnormality of {DMN} function was specifically predicted by the amount of white matter damage in the {SN} tract connecting the right anterior insulae to the presupplementary motor area and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. The results provide evidence that structural integrity of the {SN} is necessary for the efficient regulation of activity in the {DMN}, and that a failure of this regulation leads to inefficient cognitive control.},

Twenty-two people with moderate to severe {TBI} with mostly diffuse pathology and 18 demographically matched healthy controls were included in the final analysis. Graph theoretical network analysis was applied to diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) data to characterize structural connectivity in both groups. Neuropsychological functions were assessed by a battery of psychometric tests and the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale ({FrSBe}). Local connection-wise analysis demonstrated reduced structural connectivity in {TBI} arising from subcortical areas including thalamus, caudate, and hippocampus. Global network metrics revealed that shortest path length in participants with {TBI} was longer compared to controls, and that this reduced network efficiency was associated with worse performance in executive function and verbal learning. The shortest path length measure was also correlated with family-reported {FrSBe} scores. These findings support the notion that the diffuse form of neuropathology caused by {TBI} results in alterations in structural connectivity that contribute to cognitive and real-world behavioral impairment.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury affects brain connectivity by producing traumatic axonal injury. This disrupts the function of large-scale networks that support cognition. The best way to describe this relationship is unclear, but one elegant approach is to view networks as graphs. Brain regions become nodes in the graph, and white matter tracts the connections. The overall effect of an injury can then be estimated by calculating graph metrics of network structure and function. Here we test which graph metrics best predict the presence of traumatic axonal injury, as well as which are most highly associated with cognitive impairment. A comprehensive range of graph metrics was calculated from structural connectivity measures for 52 patients with traumatic brain injury, 21 of whom had microbleed evidence of traumatic axonal injury, and 25 age-matched controls. White matter connections between 165 grey matter brain regions were defined using tractography, and structural connectivity matrices calculated from skeletonized diffusion tensor imaging data. This technique estimates injury at the centre of tract, but is insensitive to damage at tract edges. Graph metrics were calculated from the resulting connectivity matrices and machine-learning techniques used to select the metrics that best predicted the presence of traumatic brain injury. In addition, we used regularization and variable selection via the elastic net to predict patient behaviour on tests of information processing speed, executive function and associative memory. Support vector machines trained with graph metrics of white matter connectivity matrices from the microbleed group were able to identify patients with a history of traumatic brain injury with 93.4\% accuracy, a result robust to different ways of sampling the data. Graph metrics were significantly associated with cognitive performance: information processing speed (R(2) = 0.64), executive function (R(2) = 0.56) and associative memory (R(2) = 0.25). These results were then replicated in a separate group of patients without microbleeds. The most influential graph metrics were betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality, which provide measures of the extent to which a given brain region connects other regions in the network. Reductions in betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality were particularly evident within hub regions including the cingulate cortex and caudate. Our results demonstrate that betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality are reduced within network hubs, due to the impact of traumatic axonal injury on network connections. The dominance of betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality suggests that cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury results from the disconnection of network hubs by traumatic axonal injury.},

	abstract = {Diffuse axonal injury after traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) produces neurological impairment by disconnecting brain networks. This structural damage can be mapped using diffusion {MRI}, and its functional effects can be investigated in large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks ({ICNs}). Here, we review evidence that {TBI} substantially disrupts {ICN} function, and that this disruption predicts cognitive impairment. We focus on two {ICNs}--the salience network and the default mode network. The activity of these {ICNs} is normally tightly coupled, which is important for attentional control. Damage to the structural connectivity of these networks produces predictable abnormalities of network function and cognitive control. For example, the brain normally shows a 'small-world architecture' that is optimized for information processing, but {TBI} shifts network function away from this organization. The effects of {TBI} on network function are likely to be complex, and we discuss how advanced approaches to modelling brain dynamics can provide insights into the network dysfunction. We highlight how structural network damage caused by axonal injury might interact with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which are late complications of {TBI}. Finally, we discuss how network-level diagnostics could inform diagnosis, prognosis and treatment development following {TBI}.},

	abstract = {Recent research on traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) has shown that impairments in cognitive and executive control functions are accompanied by a disrupted neural connectivity characterized by white matter damage. We constructed binary and weighted brain structural networks in 21 patients with chronic {TBI} and 17 healthy young adults utilizing diffusion tensor tractography and calculated topological properties of the networks using a graph theoretical method. Executive function was assessed with the local global task and the trail making task, requiring inhibition, updating, and switching. The results revealed that {TBI} patients were less successful than controls on the executive tasks, as shown by the higher reaction times, higher switch costs, and lower accuracy rates. Moreover, both {TBI} patients and controls exhibited a small world topology in their white matter networks. More importantly, the {TBI} patients demonstrated increased shortest path length and decreased global efficiency of the structural network. These findings suggest that {TBI} patients have a weaker globally integrated structural brain network, resulting in a limited capacity to integrate information across brain regions. Furthermore, we showed that the white matter networks of both groups contained highly connected hub regions that were predominately located in the parietal cortex, frontal cortex, and basal ganglia. Finally, we showed significant correlations between switching performance and network property metrics within the {TBI} group. Specifically, lower scores on the switching tasks corresponded to a lower global efficiency. We conclude that analyzing the structural brain network connectivity provides new insights into understanding cognitive control changes following brain injury.},

	abstract = {Despite an increasing amount of specific correlation studies between structural and functional connectivity, there is still a need for combined studies, especially in pathological conditions. Impairments of brain white matter ({WM}) and diffuse axonal injuries are commonly suspected to be responsible for the disconnection hypothesis in traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) patients. Moreover, our previous research on {TBI} patients shows a strong relationship between abnormalities in topological organization of brain networks and behavioral deficits. In this study, we combined task-related functional connectivity (using event-related {fMRI}) with structural connectivity (derived from fiber tractography using diffusion {MRI} data) estimates in the same participants (17 adults with {TBI} and 16 controls), allowing for direct comparison between graph metrics of the different imaging modalities. Connectivity matrices were computed covering the switching motor network, which includes the basal ganglia, anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area, and anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus. The edges constituting this network consisted of the partial correlations between the {fMRI} time series from each node of the switching motor network. The interregional anatomical connections between the switching-related areas were determined using the fiber tractography results. We found that graph metrics and hubs obtained showed no agreement in both groups. The topological properties of brain functional networks could not be solely accounted for by the properties of the underlying structural networks. However, combining complementary information from both imaging modalities could improve accuracy in prediction of switching performance. Direct comparison between functional task-related and anatomical structural connectivity, presented here for the first time in {TBI} patients, links two powerful approaches to map the patterns of brain connectivity that may underlie behavioral deficits in brain-injured patients.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury often results in cognitive impairments that limit recovery. The underlying pathophysiology of these impairments is uncertain, which restricts clinical assessment and management. Here, we use magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypotheses that: (i) traumatic brain injury results in abnormalities of functional connectivity within key cognitive networks; (ii) these changes are correlated with cognitive performance; and (iii) functional connectivity within these networks is influenced by underlying changes in structural connectivity produced by diffuse axonal injury. We studied 20 patients in the chronic phase after traumatic brain injury compared with age-matched controls. Network function was investigated in detail using functional magnetic resonance imaging to analyse both regional brain activation, and the interaction of brain regions within a network (functional connectivity). We studied patients during performance of a simple choice-reaction task and at 'rest'. Since functional connectivity reflects underlying structural connectivity, diffusion tensor imaging was used to quantify axonal injury, and test whether structural damage correlated with functional change. The patient group showed typical impairments in information processing and attention, when compared with age-matched controls. Patients were able to perform the task accurately, but showed slow and variable responses. Brain regions activated by the task were similar between the groups, but patients showed greater deactivation within the default mode network, in keeping with an increased cognitive load. A multivariate analysis of 'resting' state functional magnetic resonance imaging was then used to investigate whether changes in network function were present in the absence of explicit task performance. Overall, default mode network functional connectivity was increased in the patient group. Patients with the highest functional connectivity had the least cognitive impairment. In addition, functional connectivity at rest also predicted patterns of brain activation during later performance of the task. As expected, patients showed widespread white matter damage compared with controls. Lower default mode network functional connectivity was seen in those patients with more evidence of diffuse axonal injury within the adjacent corpus callosum. Taken together, our results demonstrate altered patterns of functional connectivity in cognitive networks following injury. The results support a direct relationship between white matter organization within the brain's structural core, functional connectivity within the default mode network and cognitive function following brain injury. They can be explained by two related changes: a compensatory increase in functional connectivity within the default mode network; and a variable degree of structural disconnection that modulates this change in network function.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) frequently produces impairments of attention in humans. These can result in a failure to maintain consistent goal-directed behavior. A predominantly right-lateralized frontoparietal network is often engaged during attentionally demanding tasks. However, lapses of attention have also been associated with increases in activation within the default mode network ({DMN}). Here, we study {TBI} patients with sustained attention impairment, defined on the basis of the consistency of their behavioral performance over time. We show that sustained attention impairments in patients are associated with an increase in {DMN} activation, particularly within the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, the interaction of the precuneus with the rest of the {DMN} at the start of the task, i.e., its functional connectivity, predicts which patients go on to show impairments of attention. Importantly, this predictive information is present before any behavioral evidence of sustained attention impairment, and the relationship is also found in a subgroup of patients without focal brain damage. {TBI} often results in diffuse axonal injury, which produces cognitive impairment by disconnecting nodes in distributed brain networks. Using diffusion tensor imaging, we demonstrate that structural disconnection within the {DMN} also correlates with the level of sustained attention. These results show that abnormalities in {DMN} function are a sensitive marker of impairments of attention and suggest that changes in connectivity within the {DMN} are central to the development of attentional impairment after {TBI}.},

{SETTING}: Inpatient brain injury rehabilitation unit.
{PARTICIPANTS}: Thirteen subjects undergoing rehabilitation after severe {TBI}.
{OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Two assessments were performed, 2 to 6 weeks apart that included the following: postural sway in three stance conditions; temporal and spatial parameters of walking; functional assessments of walking, standing up, reaching while standing, and stair climbing.
{RESULTS}: There were significant reductions in postural sway in all stance conditions (p {\textless} .05) and significant increases in velocity of walking (p {\textless} .05), stride length (p {\textless} .01), and left and right step lengths (p {\textless} .01). Performance on all functional tasks improved (p {\textless} .05) except for functional reach. There were no significant correlations between changes in postural sway and changes in walking parameters or functional assessments.
{CONCLUSION}: This study demonstrated significant improvements in postural sway, walking parameters, and functional tasks during a relatively short period of rehabilitation after severe {TBI}. Improvements in standing balance appear to be independent of improvements in walking performance, suggesting that different mechanisms underlie improved control of these tasks.},

	issn = {0195-9131},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Athletic trainers and team physicians are often faced with decisions concerning the severity and timing of an athletes return to play following mild head injury ({MHI}). These decisions can be the most difficult ones facing clinicians because of the limited amount of quantitative information indicating injury severity. Several authors have published guidelines for return to play following {MHI}, however these guidelines are based on limited scientific data. The purpose of this paper was to examine the effects of {MHI} on two objective measures, postural stability and cognitive function, to determine their usefulness in {MHI} assessment. The data gathered from these two measures has the potential to establish recovery curves based on objective data.
{METHODS}: Eleven Division I collegiate athletes who sustained a {MHI} and eleven matched control subjects were assessed for postural stability and cognitive function at four intervals following injury. Postural stability was assessed using the Sensory Organization Test on the {NeuroCom} Smart Balance Master. Cognitive functioning was measured through the use of four neuropsychological tests: Stroop Test, Trail Making Test, Digits Span and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Separate mixed model repeated measures {ANOVAs} were calculated for the composite score and three ratio (vestibular, visual and somato-sensory) scores from the Sensory Organization Test and the scores from the neuropsychological test to reveal significant differences between groups and across days postinjury.
{RESULTS}: A significant group by day interaction for overall postural stability (composite score) revealed that {MHI} athletes displayed increased postural instability for the first few days following {MHI} (p {\textless} .05). Analysis of the ratio scores revealed a significant interaction for the visual ratio. No significant group differences were revealed for any of the neuropsychological tests (p {\textgreater} .05), however significant day differences were revealed (p {\textless} .05).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The results from this study indicate that athletes demonstrate decreased stability until 3 days postinjury. It appears this deficit is related to a sensory interaction problem, whereby the injured athlete fails to use their visual system effectively. These findings suggest that measures of postural stability may provide clinicians with a useful clinical tool for determining when an athlete may safely return to competition, although these findings need to be confirmed in larger groups of athletes.},

{DESIGN}: Cross-sectional study.
{SETTING}: Rehabilitation center and supported living program.
{PARTICIPANTS}: Twenty-four individuals aged 18 to 58 years (mean = 39 years) with acquired brain injury who were able to ambulate 40 ft with (29\%) or without an assistive device. Fifty-eight percent were independent community ambulators. Fifty-four percent had fallen in the past 6 months; and 42\% reported feeling unsteady with standing or walking.
{INTERVENTIONS}: Participants completed a battery of balance, attention, and dual-task assessments.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Balance: Berg Balance Scale ({BBS}), Four Square Step Test ({FSST}), High Level Mobility Assessment Test ({HiMAT}); Attention: Symbol Digit Modalities Test ({SDMT}), Moss Attention Rating Scale ({MARS}), modified for a single test session; and a walking dual-task assessment, the Walking and Remembering Test.
{RESULTS}: Mean scores: {BBS}, 48 of 56; {FSST}, 19.6 seconds; {HiMAT}, 20 of 54; {SDMT}, 30 correct; and {MARS}, 80. Dual-task costs were observed with variable patterns across subjects: 48\% demonstrated primarily motor slowing, 9\% had reduced cognitive accuracy without motor slowing, and 35\% demonstrated decrements in both tasks. Subjects with a falls history had more impaired balance ({HiMAT}, {BBS}, and {FSST}, all P {\textless}.026) but were not significantly different in dual-task performance or attention measures.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The test battery matched the range of motor and cognitive abilities of the sample. Balance was more strongly related to falls history than measures of attention or dual-task performance. Injury chronicity may have allowed some subjects to develop strategies to optimize dual-task performance. Alternatively, motor slowing in dual-task conditions may be an adaptive strategy, allowing performance of multiple tasks with reduced safety risk. Further investigation in this area is warranted to clarify the utility of dual-task methods in identifying falls risk after brain injury.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) can lead to deficits in gait and posture, which are often asymmetric. A possible factor mediating these deficits may be asymmetry in strength of the leg muscles. However, muscle strength in the lower extremities has rarely been investigated in (young) {TBI} patients. Here, we investigated associations between lower-extremity muscle weakness, strength asymmetry, and impairments in gait and posture in young {TBI} patients. A group of young patients with moderate-to-severe {TBI} (n=19; age, 14 years 11 months ±2 years) and a group of typically developing subjects (n=31; age, 14 years 1 month±3 years) participated in this study. A force platform was used to measure postural sway to quantify balance control during normal standing and during conditions of compromised visual and/or somatosensory feedback. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were assessed during comfortable and fast-speed walking, using an electronic walkway. Muscle strength in four lower-extremity muscle groups was measured bilaterally using a handheld dynamometer. Findings revealed that {TBI} patients had poorer postural balance scores across all sensory conditions, as compared to typically developing subjects. During comfortable and fast gait, {TBI} patients demonstrated a lower gait velocity, longer double-support phase, and increased step-length asymmetry. Further, {TBI} patients had a reduced strength of leg muscles and an increased strength asymmetry. Correlation analyses revealed that asymmetry in muscle strength was predictive of a poorer balance control and a more variable and asymmetric gait. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to measure strength asymmetry in leg muscles of a sample of {TBI} patients and illustrate the importance of muscular asymmetry as a potential marker and possible risk factor of impairments in control of posture and gait.},

The cerebellum and brain stem are crucial for the neural control of posture and have been shown to be vulnerable to primary and secondary structural consequences of {TBI}. The aim of this study was to investigate whether morphometric differences in the brain stem and cerebellum can account for impairments in static and dynamic postural control in {TBI}. {TBI} patients (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 30) completed three challenging postural control tasks on the {EquiTest}® system (Neurocom). Infratentorial grey matter ({GM}) and white matter ({WM}) volumes were analyzed with cerebellum-optimized voxel-based morphometry using the spatially unbiased infratentorial toolbox. Volume loss in {TBI} patients was revealed in global cerebellar {GM}, global infratentorial {WM}, middle cerebellar peduncles, pons and midbrain. In the {TBI} group and across both groups, lower postural control performance was associated with reduced {GM} volume in the vermal/paravermal regions of lobules I-{IV}, V and {VI}. Moreover, across all participants, worse postural control performance was associated with lower {WM} volume in the pons, medulla, midbrain, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles and cerebellum. This is the first study in {TBI} patients to demonstrate an association between postural impairments and reduced volume in specific infratentorial brain areas. Volumetric measures of the brain stem and cerebellum may be valuable prognostic markers of the chronic neural pathology, which complicates rehabilitation of postural control in {TBI}.},

We constructed binary and weighted functional networks and calculated their topological properties using a graph theoretical approach. Twenty-three adults with traumatic brain injury and 26 age-matched controls were instructed to switch between coordination modes while making spatially and temporally coupled circular motions with joysticks during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results demonstrated that switching performance was significantly lower in patients with traumatic brain injury compared with control subjects. Furthermore, although brain networks of both groups exhibited economical small-world topology, altered functional connectivity was demonstrated in patients with traumatic brain injury. In particular, compared with controls, patients with traumatic brain injury showed increased connectivity degree and strength, and higher values of local efficiency, suggesting adaptive mechanisms in this group. Finally, the degree of increased connectivity was significantly correlated with poorer switching task performance and more severe brain injury.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: Traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) often results in long-term cognitive impairments. This is often due to the disruption of brain networks that support cognition. Major advances have recently been made in our understanding of these networks. Here we review work that investigates the effect of {TBI} on brain networks, and discuss the potential importance of these findings for rehabilitation.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Large-scale brain networks, which we refer to as intrinsic connectivity networks ({ICNs}), have been identified. Traumatic axonal injury disrupts their white-matter connections, and altered brain activity within the networks is frequently observed after {TBI}. These changes relate to the pattern of cognitive impairment, and are useful for predicting clinical outcome. The effect of drugs such as methylphenidate, which can be used to augment rehabilitation, are beginning to be studied in the context of their effect on network function after {TBI}.
{SUMMARY}: The assessment of brain network function after {TBI} provides insights into the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction and the mechanisms involved in recovery. These advances should provide the basis for a more detailed understanding of rehabilitation, and ultimately guide the development of targeted individualized therapy after {TBI}.},

	volume = {5},
	issn = {2158-0022},
	doi = {10.1089/brain.2014.0337},
	abstract = {The resting brain dynamics self-organize into a finite number of correlated patterns known as resting-state networks ({RSNs}). It is well known that techniques such as independent component analysis can separate the brain activity at rest to provide such {RSNs}, but the specific pattern of interaction between {RSNs} is not yet fully understood. To this aim, we propose here a novel method to compute the information flow ({IF}) between different {RSNs} from resting-state magnetic resonance imaging. After hemodynamic response function blind deconvolution of all voxel signals, and under the hypothesis that {RSNs} define regions of interest, our method first uses principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality in each {RSN} to next compute {IF} (estimated here in terms of transfer entropy) between the different {RSNs} by systematically increasing k (the number of principal components used in the calculation). When k=1, this method is equivalent to computing {IF} using the average of all voxel activities in each {RSN}. For k≥1, our method calculates the k multivariate {IF} between the different {RSNs}. We find that the average {IF} among {RSNs} is dimension dependent, increasing from k=1 (i.e., the average voxel activity) up to a maximum occurring at k=5 and to finally decay to zero for k≥10. This suggests that a small number of components (close to five) is sufficient to describe the {IF} pattern between {RSNs}. Our method--addressing differences in {IF} between {RSNs} for any generic data--can be used for group comparison in health or disease. To illustrate this, we have calculated the inter-{RSN} {IF} in a data set of Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) to find that the most significant differences between {AD} and controls occurred for k=2, in addition to {AD} showing increased {IF} w.r.t.
{CONTROLS}: The spatial localization of the k=2 component, within {RSNs}, allows the characterization of {IF} differences between {AD} and controls.},

This is a consequence of activity-dependent synaptic fluctuations, which continuously destabilize the attractor and induce irregular hopping to other possible attractors. The nature of these irregularities depends on the dynamic details, namely, on the intensity of the synaptic noise and the number of sites of the network, which are synchronously updated at each time step. Varying these factors, different regimes occur, ranging from regular to chaotic dynamics. As a result, and in absence of external agents, the chaotic behavior may turn regular after tuning the noise intensity. It is argued that a similar mechanism might be on the basis of self-controlling chaos in natural systems.},

	abstract = {In addition to the characteristic motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease ({PD}) often involves a constellation of sleep and mood symptoms. However, the mechanisms underlying these comorbidities are largely unknown. We have previously reconstructed gene networks in the striatum of a population of (C57BL/6J x A/J) F2 mice and associated the networks to sleep and affective phenotypes, providing a resource for integrated analyses to investigate perturbed sleep and affective functions at the gene network level. Combining this resource with {PD}-relevant transcriptomic datasets from humans and mice, we identified four networks that showed elevated gene expression in {PD} patients, including a circadian clock and mitotic network that was altered similarly in mouse models of {PD}. We then utilized multiple types of omics data from public databases and linked this gene network to postsynaptic dopamine signaling in the striatum, {CDK}1-modulated transcriptional regulation, and the genetic susceptibility of {PD}. These findings suggest that dopamine deficiency, a key aspect of {PD} pathology, perturbs a circadian/mitotic gene network in striatal neurons. Since the normal functions of this network were relevant to sleep and affective behaviors, these findings implicate that dysregulation of functional gene networks may be involved in the emergence of non-motor symptoms in {PD}. Our analyses present a framework for integrating multi-omics data from diverse sources in mice and humans to reveal insights into comorbid symptoms of complex diseases.},

We hypothesized that the distribution of neuropathological changes might be correlated with the extent of the length of the {CTG} repeats in the {DMPK} genes in {DM}1 patients. We studied the neuropathological changes in the brains of subjects with {DM}1 and investigated the extent of somatic instability in terms of {CTG} repeat expansion in the different brain regions of the same individuals by Southern blot analysis. The neuropathological changes included état criblé in the cerebral deep white matter and neurofibrillary tangles immunoreactive for phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, both of which were compatible with the subcortical dementia in {DM}1 patients. However, the length of the {CTG} repeats did not correlate with the regional differences in the extent of neuropathological changes. Our data suggested that pathomechanisms of dementia in {DM}1 might be more multifactorial rather than a toxic gain-of-function due to mutant {RNA}.},

Guanidine and substituted guanidines react with 2,4-pentanedione to form N-substituted 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidines at a rate which is lower by at least a factor of 20 than the rate of reaction of 2,4-pentanedione with primary amines. Selective modification of lysine and arginine side chains in proteins can readily be achieved with 2,4-pentanedione. Modification of lysine is favored by reaction at {pH} 7 or for short reaction times at {pH} 9. Selective modification of arginine is achieved by reaction with 2,4-pentanedione for long times at {pH} 9, followed by treatment of the protein with hydroxylamine. The extent of modification of lysine and arginine side chains can readily be measured spectrophotometrically. Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at {pH} 7 results in modification of 3.8 lysine residues and less than 0.4 arginine residue in 24 hr. Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at {pH} 9 results in modification of 4 lysine residues and 4.5 arginine residues in 100 hr.

	abstract = {Visuomotor impairments characterize numerous neurological disorders and neurogenetic syndromes, such as autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) and Dravet, Fragile X, Prader–Willi, Turner, and Williams syndromes. Despite recent advances in systems neuroscience, the biological basis underlying visuomotor functional impairments associated with these clinical conditions is poorly understood. In this study, we used neuroimaging connectomic approaches to map the visuomotor integration ({VMI}) system in the human brain and investigated the topology approximation of the {VMI} network to the Allen Human Brain Atlas, a whole-brain transcriptome-wide atlas of cortical genetic expression. We found the genetic expression of four genes—{TBR}1, {SCN}1A, {MAGEL}2, and {CACNB}4—to be prominently associated with visuomotor integrators in the human cortex. {TBR}1 gene transcripts, an {ASD} gene whose expression is related to neural development of the cortex and the hippocampus, showed a central spatial allocation within the {VMI} system. Our findings delineate gene expression traits underlying the {VMI} system in the human cortex, where specific genes, such as {TBR}1, are likely to play a central role in its neuronal organization, as well as on specific phenotypes of neurogenetic syndromes.},

	abstract = {Myotonic dystrophy is the most common muscular dystrophy in adults and the first recognized example of an {RNA}-mediated disease. Congenital myotonic dystrophy ({CDM}1) and myotonic dystrophy of type 1 ({DM}1) or of type 2 ({DM}2) are caused by the expression of mutant {RNAs} containing expanded {CUG} or {CCUG} repeats, respectively. These mutant {RNAs} sequester the splicing regulator Muscleblind-like-1 ({MBNL}1), resulting in specific misregulation of the alternative splicing of other pre-{mRNAs}. We found that alternative splicing of the bridging integrator-1 ({BIN}1) pre-{mRNA} is altered in skeletal muscle samples of people with {CDM}1, {DM}1 and {DM}2. {BIN}1 is involved in tubular invaginations of membranes and is required for the biogenesis of muscle T tubules, which are specialized skeletal muscle membrane structures essential for excitation-contraction coupling. Mutations in the {BIN}1 gene cause centronuclear myopathy, which shares some histopathological features with myotonic dystrophy. We found that {MBNL}1 binds the {BIN}1 pre-{mRNA} and regulates its alternative splicing. {BIN}1 missplicing results in expression of an inactive form of {BIN}1 lacking phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate-binding and membrane-tubulating activities. Consistent with a defect of {BIN}1, muscle T tubules are altered in people with myotonic dystrophy, and membrane structures are restored upon expression of the normal splicing form of {BIN}1 in muscle cells of such individuals. Finally, reproducing {BIN}1 splicing alteration in mice is sufficient to promote T tubule alterations and muscle weakness, a predominant feature of myotonic dystrophy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 ({DM}1) represents a multisystemic disorder in which diffuse brain white and gray matter alterations related to clinical and genetic features have been described. We aimed to evaluate in the brain of adult patients with {DM}1 (i) white and gray matter differences, including cortical-subcortical gray matter volume and cortical thickness and (ii) their correlation with clinical disability, global neuropsychological performance and triplet expansion.
{METHODS}: We included 24 adult genetically-confirmed {DM}1 patients (14 males; age: 38.5 ± 11.8 years) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (14 males; age: 38.5 ± 11.3 years) who underwent an identical brain {MR} protocol including high-resolution 3D T1-weighted, axial T2 {FLAIR} and {DTI} sequences. All patients underwent an extensive clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. Voxel-wise analyses of white matter, performed by using Tract Based Spatial Statistics, and of gray matter, with Voxel-based Morphometry and Cortical Thickness, were carried out in order to test for differences between patients with {DM}1 and healthy controls (p {\textless} 0.05, corrected). The correlation between {MRI} measures and clinical-genetic features was also assessed.
{RESULTS}: Patients with {DM}1 showed widespread abnormalities of all {DTI} parameters in the white matter, which were associated with reduced gray matter volume in all brain lobes and thinning in parieto-temporo-occipital cortices, albeit with less extensive cortical alterations when congenital cases were removed from the analyses. White matter alterations correlated with clinical disability, global cognitive performance and triplet expansions.
{CONCLUSION}: In patients with {DM}1, the combined smaller overall gray matter volume and white matter alterations seem to be the main morpho-structural substrates of {CNS} involvement in this condition. The correlation of white matter differences with both clinical and genetic findings lends support to this notion.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2 ({DM}1/{DM}2) are multisystemic diseases with common cognitive deficits beside the cardinal muscular symptoms. We performed a comprehensive analysis of cerebral abnormalities to compare the neuropsychological defects with findings in different imaging methods in the same cohort of patients.
{METHODS}: Neuropsychological investigations, structural cerebral {MRI} including brain parenchymal fraction ({BPF}) and voxel-based morphometry ({VBM}), and (18)F-deoxy-glucose {PET} ({FDG}-{PET}) were performed in patients (20 {DM}1 and 9 {DM}2) and matched healthy controls, and analyzed using statistical parametric mapping ({SPM}2).
{RESULTS}: {DM}1 and {DM}2 patients showed typical neuropsychological deficits with a pronounced impairment of nonverbal episodic memory. Both patient groups showed a reduction of the global gray matter (measured by {BPF}), which could be localized to the frontal and parietal lobes by {VBM}. Interestingly, {VBM} revealed a bilateral hippocampal volume reduction that was correlated specifically to both a clinical score and episodic memory deficits. {VBM} also revealed a pronounced change of thalamic gray matter. White matter lesions were found in {\textgreater}50\% of patients and their extent was correlated to psychomotor speed. {FDG}-{PET} revealed a frontotemporal hypometabolism, independent of the decrease in cortical gray matter. All abnormalities were similar in both patient groups but more pronounced for {DM}1.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our results suggest that 1) some of the characteristic cognitive deficits of these patients are linked to specific structural cerebral changes, 2) decreases in gray matter and metabolism are independent processes, and 3) the widespread brain abnormalities are more pronounced in {DM}1.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Central nervous system involvement occurs in most patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 ({DM}1): mental retardation characterizes congenital forms, while a mild cognitive impairment has been described in adult patients with classic {DM}1. Neuropathological studies documented neurofibrillary tangles and an aberrant tau-protein expression in brain tissues of patients and animal models of {DM}1.
{OBJECTIVES}: To characterize the pattern of cognitive dysfunction occurring in {DM}1 and to analyze genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with {DM}1.
{METHODS}: We assessed the results of a detailed neuropsychological study, including Mini-Mental State Examination, memory, linguistic level, praxis, attentional and frontal-executive tasks, in a group of 70 patients with {DM}1, including 10 congenital and 60 classic forms. Statistical analysis of data was performed using analysis of variance for multiple tests.
{RESULTS}: Our study documented 2 distinct patterns of cognitive impairment in {DM}1: in particular, we confirmed the presence of a cognitive pattern characteristic of mental retardation in congenital cases, whereas in adult forms we documented an aging-related decline of frontal and temporal cognitive functions. No correlations were found between cognitive impairment and ({CTG})(n) in leukocytes or severity of muscle involvement.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Adult patients with {DM}1 frequently develop, with aging, a focal dementia: such findings agree with recent studies documenting an abnormal tau-protein expression in the brain tissues of patients with {DM}1. Cognitive decline may represent the only relevant clinical manifestation of {DM}1 in patients carrying very small ({CTG})(n) expansions in leukocytes.},

Concentration of various hormones and metabolites in venous blood was used to assess the endocrine function in 97 patients with {DM}1. Correlation with {CTG}(n) expansion size was investigated with the Pearson correlation test. Eighteen percent of the {DM}1 patients had hyperparathyroidism with increased {PTH} compared with 0.5\% in the background population. Of these, 16\% had normocalcemia and 2\% had hypercalcemia. An additional 3\% had hypercalcemia without elevation of {PTH}; 7\% had abnormal {TSH} values (2\% subnormal and 5\% elevated {TSH} levels); 5\% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus; 17\% of the male {DM}1 patients had increased {LH} and low levels of plasma testosterone indicating absolute androgen insufficiency. Another 21\% had increased {LH}, but normal testosterone levels, indicating relative insufficiency. Numbers of {CTG} repeats correlated directly with plasma {PTH}, phosphate, {LH}, and tended to correlate with plasma testosterone for males. This is the largest study of endocrine dysfunction in a cohort of Caucasian patients with {DM}1. We found that patients with {DM}1 have an increased risk of abnormal endocrine function, particularly calcium metabolism disorders. However, the endocrine dysfunction appears not to be of clinical significance in all of the cases. Finally, we found correlations between {CTG}(n) expansion size and plasma {PTH}, phosphate, and testosterone, and neck flexion strength.},

	abstract = {Myotonic dystrophy type 1 ({DM}1) represents the 1 chronic neuromuscular disease with the most prominent sleep disorders, including excessive daytime sleepiness ({EDS}), sleep apneas, periodic leg movements during sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep dysregulation. The large majority of {DM}1 patients complain about {EDS}, which may have a deleterious impact on work, domestic responsibilities, social life, and quality of life. Here, we review the extant literature and report that studies are largely supportive of the view that {DM}1-related {EDS} is primarily caused by a central dysfunction of sleep regulation rather than by sleep-related disordered breathing ({SRDB}) or sleep fragmentation. The pathogenesis of {EDS} in {DM}1 still remains unclear but several arguments favor a model in which brain/brainstem nuclear accumulations of toxic expanded {DM} protein kinase ({DMPK}) gene are responsible for aberrant genes expression in modifying alternative splicing. Regarding management, early recognition, and treatment of {SRDB} with nocturnal noninvasive mechanical ventilation is first mandatory. However, despite its appropriate management, {EDS} often persists and may require a psychostimulant but no consensus has been yet established. Further studies are needed to clarify the discrepancies between daytime sleepiness/fatigue complaints and subjective/objective measurement of daytime sleepiness, the role of cognitive impairment and apathy in this relationship, and its reversibility with appropriate management.},

Ventilatory {CO}2 response was measured by the estimation of the steady-state effect of a sufficiently large serial dead space. Variability of resting breathing pattern was expressed by the variation coefficients of respiratory cycle time and tidal volume. The group means of the total lung capacity ({TLC}), vital capacity ({VC}), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec ({FEV})1 and forced inspiratory volume in 1 sec ({FIV})1 showed a restrictive pattern. Only maximal static mouth pressure (Pi,max), measured at residual volume ({RV}) level, showed a significant positive correlation with both {VC} (p = 0.03) and {FIV}1 (p = 0.02), suggesting inspiratory muscle weakness as a determinant of the restriction. Although the differences were just not significant, both variation coefficients of the respiratory cycle time and tidal volume were larger in the group with a {CO}2 sensitivity below the lower limit of normal compared to those with a normal ventilatory response to {CO}2. In 3 patients, fluctuations in {FRC} were also present. We hypothesize that, in addition to the already documented {FRC} fluctuations by uncoordinated spontaneous intercostal muscle action, a defect of integration of afferent neural input and chemical drive in the medullary region may also be present in these patients.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: To quantify the association between myotonic dystrophy ({DM}) and cardiac disease in a nationwide cohort.
{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We identified a nationwide cohort of 1146 {DM} patients (period 1977-2011) using the National Patient Registry ({NPR}) and a subcohort of 485 patients who had undergone genetic testing for {DM}1. Information on incident cardiac diseases was obtained from the {NPR}. We estimated standardized incidence ratios ({SIRs}) of cardiac disease compared with the background population, overall and according to selected diagnostic subgroups (cardiomyopathy, heart failure, conduction disorders, arrhythmias, and device implantation). In the {DM} cohort, {SIR} for any cardiac disease was 3.42 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 3.01-3.86]; for a cardiac disease belonging to the selected subgroups 6.91 (95\% {CI}: 5.93-8.01) and for other cardiac disease 2.59 (95\% {CI}: 2.03-3.25). For a cardiac disease belonging to the selected subgroups, the risk was particularly high in the first year after {DM} diagnosis [{SIR} 15.4 (95\% {CI}: 10.9-21.3)] but remained significantly elevated in subsequent years [{SIR} 6.07 (95\% {CI}: 5.11-7.16]). The risk was higher in young cohort members [e.g. 20-39 years: {SIR} 18.1 (95\% {CI}: 12.3-25.8)] compared with older [e.g. 60-79 years: {SIR} 3.99 (95\% {CI}: 2.98-5.23)] but remained significantly increased in all age categories. Results were similar in separate analyses of the genetically confirmed {DM}1 patients.
{CONCLUSION}: Myotonic dystrophy is strongly associated with cardiac disease. The risk is pronounced in the young and remains elevated throughout life, stressing the importance of lifelong cardiac follow-up from time of {DM} diagnosis.},

The objective of this study was to assess brain functionality and brain circuit alterations in a patient with an ultra-rare inborn error of cobalamin metabolism, methylmalonic aciduria, and homocystinuria due to cobalamin D disease, as compared with his twin sister as a healthy control ({HC}). We acquired magnetic resonance imaging (including structural, functional, and diffusion images) to calculate brain circuit abnormalities and combined these results with the scores after a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. As compared with {HC}, the patient had severe patterns of damage, such as a 254\% increment of ventricular volume, pronounced subcortical and cortical atrophies (mainly at striatum, cingulate cortex, and precuneus), and connectivity alterations at fronto-striato-thalamic circuit, cerebellum, and corpus callosum. In agreement with brain circuit alterations, cognitive deficits existed in attention, executive function, inhibitory control, and mental flexibility. This is the first study that provides the clinical, genetic, neuroanatomical, neuropsychological, and psychosocial characterization of a patient with the cobalamin D disorder, showing functional alterations in central nervous system motor tracts, thalamus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, that, as far as we know, have not been reported yet in vitamin B12-related disorders.},

	abstract = {Traditionally seen as a sudden, brutal event with short-term impairment, traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) may cause persistent, sometimes life-long, consequences. While mortality after {TBI} has been reduced, a high proportion of severe {TBI} survivors require prolonged rehabilitation and may suffer long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological disorders. Additionally, chronic consequences have been identified not only after severe {TBI} but also in a proportion of cases previously classified as moderate or mild. This burden affects the daily life of survivors and their families; it also has relevant social and economic costs.Outcome evaluation is difficult for several reasons: co-existing extra-cranial injuries (spinal cord damage, for instance) may affect independence and quality of life outside the pure {TBI} effects; scales may not capture subtle, but important, changes; co-operation from patients may be impossible in the most severe cases. Several instruments have been developed for capturing specific aspects, from generic health status to specific cognitive functions. Even simple instruments, however, have demonstrated variable inter-rater agreement.The possible links between structural traumatic brain damage and functional impairment have been explored both experimentally and in the clinical setting with advanced neuro-imaging techniques. We briefly report on some fundamental findings, which may also offer potential targets for future therapies.Better understanding of damage mechanisms and new approaches to neuroprotection-restoration may offer better outcomes for the millions of survivors of {TBI}.},

The {PedsQL} 4.0 Generic Core Scales are multidimensional child self-report and parent proxy-report scales developed as the generic core measure to be integrated with the {PedsQL} Disease-Specific Modules. The {PedsQL} 4.0 Generic Core Scales consist of 23 items applicable for healthy school and community populations, as well as pediatric populations with acute and chronic health conditions.
{METHODS}: The 4 {PedsQL} 4.0 Generic Core Scales (Physical, Emotional, Social, School) were administered to 963 children and 1,629 parents (1,677 subjects accrued overall) recruited from pediatric health care settings. Item-level and scale-level measurement properties were computed.
{RESULTS}: Internal consistency reliability for the Total Scale Score (alpha = 0.88 child, 0.90 parent report), Physical Health Summary Score (alpha = 0.80 child, 0.88 parent), and Psychosocial Health Summary Score (alpha = 0.83 child, 0.86 parent) were acceptable for group comparisons. Validity was demonstrated using the known-groups method, correlations with indicators of morbidity and illness burden, and factor analysis. The {PedsQL} distinguished between healthy children and pediatric patients with acute or chronic health conditions, was related to indicators of morbidity and illness burden, and displayed a factor-derived solution largely consistent with the a priori conceptually-derived scales.
{CONCLUSION}: The results demonstrate the reliability and validity of the {PedsQL} 4.0 Generic Core Scales. The {PedsQL} 4.0 Generic Core Scales may be applicable in clinical trials, research, clinical practice, school health settings, and community populations.},

	abstract = {Anti-{PTEN} monoclonal antibodies ({mAb}) are arising as important tools for immunohistochemistry ({IHC}) and protein quantification routine analysis in clinical oncology. Although an effort has been made to document the reliability of tumor tissue section immunostaining by anti-{PTEN} {mAb}, and to standardize their {IHC} use in research and in the clinical practice, the precise topological and biochemical definition of the epitope recognized by each {mAb} has been conventionally overlooked. In this study, six commercial anti-{PTEN} {mAb} have been validated and characterized for sensitivity and specificity by {IHC} and {FISH}, using a set of prostate and urothelial bladder tumor specimens, and by immunoblot, using {PTEN} positive and {PTEN} negative human cell lines. Immunoblot precise epitope mapping, performed using recombinant {PTEN} variants and mutations, revealed that all {mAb} recognized linear epitopes of 6-11 amino acid length at the {PTEN} C-terminus. Tumor-associated or disease-associated mutations at the {PTEN} C-terminus did not affect subcellular localization or {PIP}3 phosphatase activity of {PTEN} in cells, although resulted in specific loss of reactivity for some {mAb}. Furthermore, specific mimicking-phosphorylation mutations at the {PTEN} C-terminal region also abolished binding of specific {mAb}. Our study adds new evidence on the relevance of a precise epitope mapping in the validation of anti-{PTEN} {mAb} for their use in the clinics. This will be substantial to provide a more accurate diagnosis in clinical oncology based on {PTEN} protein expression in tumors and biological fluids.},

	abstract = {Functional brain imaging studies have shown abnormal neural activity in individuals recovered from anorexia nervosa ({AN}) during both cognitive and emotional task paradigms. It has been suggested that this abnormal activity which persists into recovery might underpin the neurobiology of the disorder and constitute a neural biomarker for {AN}. However, no study to date has assessed functional changes in neural networks in the absence of task-induced activity in those recovered from {AN}. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whole brain resting state functional connectivity in nonmedicated women recovered from anorexia nervosa. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 16 nonmedicated participants recovered from anorexia nervosa and 15 healthy control participants. Independent component analysis revealed functionally relevant resting state networks. Dual regression analysis revealed increased temporal correlation (coherence) in the default mode network ({DMN}) which is thought to be involved in self-referential processing. Specifically, compared to healthy control participants the recovered anorexia nervosa participants showed increased temporal coherence between the {DMN} and the precuneus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/inferior frontal gyrus. The findings support the view that dysfunction in resting state functional connectivity in regions involved in self-referential processing and cognitive control might be a vulnerability marker for the development of anorexia nervosa.},

	abstract = {Childhood brain tumors and associated treatment have been shown to affect brain development and cognitive outcomes. Understanding the functional connectivity of brain many years after diagnosis and treatment may inform the development of interventions to improve the long-term outcomes of adult survivors of childhood brain tumors. This work investigated the frontal region functional connectivity of 16 adult survivors of childhood cerebellar tumors after an average of 14.9 years from diagnosis and 16 demographically-matched controls using resting state functional {MRI} (rs-{fMRI}). Independent component analysis ({ICA}) was applied to identify the resting state activity from rs-{fMRI} data and to select the specific regions associated with executive functions, followed by the secondary analysis of the functional networks connecting these regions. It was found that survivors exhibited differences in the functional connectivity in executive control network ({ECN}), default mode network ({DMN}) and salience network ({SN}) compared to demographically-matched controls. More specifically, the number of functional connectivity observed in the survivors is higher than that in the controls, and with increased strength, or stronger correlation coefficient between paired seeds, in survivors compared to the controls. Observed hyperconnectivity in the selected frontal functional network thus is consistent with findings in patients with other neurological injuries and diseases.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In some prospective studies, associations of serum vitamin B(12) and homocysteine concentrations with cognitive decline have been reported but few have examined the role of methylmalonic acid, a more specific marker of vitamin B(12) deficiency than homocysteine.
{OBJECTIVE}: The aim of the study was to determine whether serum concentrations of vitamin B(12) or selected metabolites are related to cognitive decline.
{METHODS}: A total of 516 subjects were selected in a stratified random sampling design from among Chicago Health and Aging Project participants for clinical evaluation. We used linear mixed models to examine the association of blood markers of vitamin B(12) status to change in cognitive scores over 6 years. Cognitive function was assessed every 3 years and measured as the sum of standardized scores on four tests.
{RESULTS}: Probable vitamin B(12) deficiency was observed in 14.2\% of the sample. Elevated serum concentrations of homocysteine were present in 19.2\% of subjects, and of methylmalonic acid, in 36.4\%. Higher serum methylmalonic acid concentrations were predictive of faster rates of cognitive decline (beta = -0.00016, {SE} = 0.0001, p = 0.004) and higher serum vitamin B(12) concentrations were associated with slower rates of cognitive decline (beta = +0.00013, {SE} {\textless} 0.0001, p = 0.005) in multivariable adjusted mixed models. Serum concentrations of homocysteine had no relationship to cognitive decline.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Serum methylmalonic acid and vitamin B(12) concentrations may be the more important risk factors for cognitive decline when compared to serum homocysteine concentrations, particularly in older populations exposed to food fortification and possible supplements containing folic acid.},

The ataxia was totally and the neuropathy partially preventable by dietary methionine supplementation. Methionine synthase activity was inhibited in both the liver and brain. There was a marked elevation of S-adenosylhomocysteine in the neural tissues and a concomitant failure of S-adenosylmethionine to rise and thus maintain the methylation ratio, except when supplementary dietary methionine was added. In contrast, the methylation ratio in the rat was affected to a lesser extent. The neuropathy, it is suggested, is caused by raised S-adenosylhomocysteine levels in neural tissue; as a result, the methylation ratio is inverted and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reactions are inhibited.},

	abstract = {We reviewed 153 episodes of cobalamin deficiency involving the nervous system that occurred in 143 patients seen over a recent 17-year period at 2 New York City hospitals. Pernicious anemia was the most common underlying cause of the deficiency. Neurologic complaints, most commonly paresthesias or ataxia, were the first symptoms of Cbl deficiency in most episodes. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis and treatment with vitamin B12 was 4 months, although long delays in diagnosis occurred in some patients. Diminished vibratory sensation and proprioception in the lower extremities were the most common objective findings. A wide variety of neurologic symptoms and signs were encountered, however, including ataxia, loss of cutaneous sensation, muscle weakness, diminished or hyperactive reflexes, spasticity, urinary or fecal incontinence, orthostatic hypotension, loss of vision, dementia, psychoses, and disturbances of mood. Multiple neurologic syndromes were often seen in a single patient. In 42 (27.4\%) of the 153 episodes, the hematocrit was normal, and in 31 (23.0\%), the mean corpuscular volume was normal. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were unusual even in anemic patients. In nonanemic patients in whom diagnosis was delayed, neurologic progression frequently occurred although the hematocrit remained normal. In 27 episodes, the serum cobalamin concentration was only moderately decreased (in the range of 100-200 pg/ml) and in 2 the serum level was normal. Neurologic impairment, as assessed by a quantitative severity score, was judged to be mild in 99 episodes, moderate in 39 and severe in 15. Severity of neurologic dysfunction before treatment was clearly related to the duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis. In addition, the hematocrit correlated significantly with severity, independent of the longer duration of symptoms in nonanemic patients. Four patients experienced transient neurologic exacerbations soon after beginning treatment with cyanocobalamin, with subsequent recovery. Followup evaluation was adequate to assess the neurologic response to vitamin B12 therapy in 121 episodes. All patients responded, and in 57 (47.1\%), recovery was complete, with no remaining symptoms or findings on examination. The severity score was reduced by 50\% or greater after treatment in 91\% of the episodes. Residual long-term moderate or severe neurologic disability was noted following only 7 (6.3\%) episodes. The extent of neurologic involvement after treatment was strongly related to that before therapy as well as to the duration of symptoms. The percent improvement over baseline neurologic status after treatment was inversely related to duration of symptoms and hematocrit. Some evidence of response was always seen during the first 3 months of treatment.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {The {cblD} defect of intracellular vitamin B(12) metabolism can lead to isolated methylmalonic aciduria ({cblD}-{MMA}) or homocystinuria ({cblD}-{HC}), or combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria ({cblD}-{MMA}/{HC}). We studied the mechanism whereby {MMADHC} mutations can lead to three phenotypes. The effect of various expression vectors containing {MMADHC} modified to contain an enhanced mitochondrial leader sequence or mutations changing possible downstream sites of reinitiation of translation or mutations introducing stop codons on rescue of adenosyl- and methylcobalamin ({MeCbl}) formation was studied. The constructs were transfected into cell lines derived from various {cblD} patient's fibroblasts. Expression of 10 mutant alleles from 15 {cblD} patients confirmed that the nature and location of the mutations correlate with the biochemical phenotype. In {cblD}-{MMA}/{HC} cells, improving mitochondrial targeting of {MMADHC} clearly increased the formation of adenosylcobalamin ({AdoCbl}) with a concomitant decrease in {MeCbl} formation. In {cblD}-{MMA} cells, this effect was dependent on the mutation and showed a negative correlation with endogenous {MMADHC} {mRNA} levels. These findings support the hypothesis that a single protein exists with two different functional domains that interact with either cytosolic or mitochondrial targets. Also a delicate balance exists between cytosolic {MeCbl} and mitochondrial {AdoCbl} synthesis, supporting the role of {cblD} protein as a branch point in intracellular cobalamin trafficking. Furthermore, our data indicate that the sequence after Met116 is sufficient for {MeCbl} synthesis, whereas the additional sequence between Met62 and Met116 is required for {AdoCbl} synthesis. Accordingly, western blot studies reveal proteins of the size expected from the stop codon position with subsequent reinitiation of translation.},

	abstract = {Cobalamin D deficiency ({cblD}) is one of the least common cobalamin metabolism disorders. It may result in isolated homocystinuria, isolated methylmalonic aciduria, or combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria ({cblD}-combined). Only seven cases of the combined {cblD} form have been reported to date. Due to the rarity of this disorder, the presentation and symptoms are not well described. We present an eighth case of the {cblD}-combined subtype, who had a positive newborn screen ({NBS}) on day of life 3. She was symptomatic and developed lethargy and poor oral intake at 8 days of life. She was treated with 10\% dextrose, folinic acid, intramuscular hydroxocobalamin, and betaine. Despite the early initiation of treatment, she developed complications of the disease and was found to have abnormal brain imaging findings at 17 days of age and macular atrophy at 3 months of age and has global developmental delay. We provide detailed description of her presentation, her treatment, and her complications to aid in the understanding of this rare disorder, which is very similar to the more common cobalamin C disorder ({cblC}).},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To describe 3 patients with the {cblD} disorder, a rare inborn error of cobalamin metabolism caused by mutations in the {MMADHC} gene that can result in isolated homocystinuria, isolated methylmalonic aciduria, or combined homocystinuria and methylmalonic aciduria.
{STUDY} {DESIGN}: Patient clinical records were reviewed. Biochemical and somatic cell genetic studies were performed on cultured fibroblasts. Sequence analysis of the {MMADHC} gene was performed on patient {DNA}.
{RESULTS}: Patient 1 presented with isolated methylmalonic aciduria, patient 3 with isolated homocystinuria, and patient 2 with combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria. Studies of cultured fibroblasts confirmed decreased synthesis of adenosylcobalamin in patient 1, decreased synthesis of methylcobalamin in patient 3, and decreased synthesis of both cobalamin derivatives in patient 2. The diagnosis of {cblD} was established in each patient by complementation analysis. Mutations in the {MMADHC} gene were identified in all patients.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The results emphasize the heterogeneous clinical, cellular and molecular phenotype of the {cblD} disorder. The results of molecular analysis of the {MMADHC} gene are consistent with the hypothesis that mutations affecting the N terminus of the {MMADHC} protein are associated with methylmalonic aciduria, and mutations affecting the C terminus are associated with homocystinuria.},

	doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa072200},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is an essential cofactor in several metabolic pathways. Intracellular conversion of cobalamin to its two coenzymes, adenosylcobalamin in mitochondria and methylcobalamin in the cytoplasm, is necessary for the homeostasis of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. Nine defects of intracellular cobalamin metabolism have been defined by means of somatic complementation analysis. One of these defects, the {cblD} defect, can cause isolated methylmalonic aciduria, isolated homocystinuria, or both. Affected persons present with multisystem clinical abnormalities, including developmental, hematologic, neurologic, and metabolic findings. The gene responsible for the {cblD} defect has not been identified.
{METHODS}: We studied seven patients with the {cblD} defect, and skin fibroblasts from each were investigated in cell culture. Microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and refined genetic mapping were used to localize the responsible gene. This gene was transfected into {cblD} fibroblasts to test for the rescue of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin synthesis.
{RESULTS}: The {cblD} gene was localized to human chromosome 2q23.2, and a candidate gene, designated {MMADHC} (methylmalonic aciduria, {cblD} type, and homocystinuria), was identified in this region. Transfection of wild-type {MMADHC} rescued the cellular phenotype, and the functional importance of mutant alleles was shown by means of transfection with mutant constructs. The predicted {MMADHC} protein has sequence homology with a bacterial {ATP}-binding cassette transporter and contains a putative cobalamin binding motif and a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Mutations in a gene we designated {MMADHC} are responsible for the {cblD} defect in vitamin B12 metabolism. Various mutations are associated with each of the three biochemical phenotypes of the disorder.},

	abstract = {Aging is often accompanied by learning and memory problems, many of which resemble deficits associated with hippocampal damage. Studies of aging in nonhuman animals have demonstrated hippocampus-related memory decline, and point to a possible locus for impairments associated with normal and pathological aging in humans. Two well-characterized hippocampus-dependent tasks in nonhuman animal literature are the Morris water task ({MWT}) and the transverse patterning discrimination task ({TPDT}). We employed the virtual {MWT} and the {TPDT} to assess hippocampus-dependent cognition in humans. Magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were employed to measure hippocampal volume and neurochemistry respectively. Age-related deficits were observed in performance on both hippocampus-dependent tasks. This pattern of impairment was accompanied by decreased hippocampal {NAA}/Cre ratios and volume, both of which imply neuronal loss and/or decrease in neuronal density. Collectively, our results suggest that hippocampus undergoes structural and biochemical changes with normal aging and that these changes may represent an important component of age-related deterioration in hippocampus-dependent cognition.},

	abstract = {In brains of higher vertebrates, the functional segregation of local areas that differ in their anatomy and physiology contrasts sharply with their global integration during perception and behavior. In this paper, we introduce a measure, called neural complexity ({CN}), that captures the interplay between these two fundamental aspects of brain organization. We express functional segregation within a neural system in terms of the relative statistical independence of small subsets of the system and functional integration in terms of significant deviations from independence of large subsets. {CN} is then obtained from estimates of the average deviation from statistical independence for subsets of increasing size. {CN} is shown to be high when functional segregation coexists with integration and to be low when the components of a system are either completely independent (segregated) or completely dependent (integrated). We apply this complexity measure in computer simulations of cortical areas to examine how some basic principles of neuroanatomical organization constrain brain dynamics. We show that the connectivity patterns of the cerebral cortex, such as a high density of connections, strong local connectivity organizing cells into neuronal groups, patchiness in the connectivity among neuronal groups, and prevalent reciprocal connections, are associated with high values of {CN}. The approach outlined here may prove useful in analyzing complexity in other biological domains such as gene regulation and embryogenesis.},

The model is supported by functional neuroimaging and other evidence in the domains of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perception, and inhibitory control. Age-related hemispheric asymmetry reductions may have a compensatory function or they may reflect a dedifferentiation process.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Normal aging is accompanied by a decline of cognitive abilities, and executive skills may be affected selectively, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure and preventive strategies are lacking. It has been suggested that cortical "disconnection" due to the loss of white matter fibers may play an important role. But, to date, there has been no direct demonstration of structural disconnection in humans in vivo.
{METHODS}: The authors used diffusion tensor {MRI} to look for evidence of ultrastructural changes in cerebral white matter in a group of 20 elderly volunteers with normal conventional {MRI} scans, and a group of 10 younger controls. The older group also underwent neuropsychological assessment.
{RESULTS}: Diffusional anisotropy, a marker of white matter tract integrity, was reduced in the white matter of older subjects and fell linearly with increasing age in the older group. Mean diffusivity was higher in the older group and increased with age. These changes were maximal in anterior white matter. In the older group, anterior mean diffusivity correlated with executive function assessed by the Trail Making Test.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These findings provide direct evidence that white matter tract disruption occurs in normal aging and would be consistent with the cortical disconnection hypothesis of age-related cognitive decline. Maximal changes in anterior white matter provide a plausible structural basis for selective loss of executive functions. In addition to providing new information about the biological basis of cognitive abilities, diffusion tensor {MRI} may be a sensitive tool for assessing interventions aimed at preventing cognitive decline.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: To determine longitudinally the rate of change in diffusion-tensor imaging ({DTI}) parameters of white matter microstructure with aging and to investigate whether cardiovascular risk factors influence this longitudinal change.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: This prospective population-based cohort study was approved by a dedicated ethics committee overseen by the national government, and all participants gave written informed consent. Community-dwelling participants without dementia were examined by using a research-dedicated 1.5-T magnetic resonance ({MR}) imager on two separate visits that were, on average, 2.0 years apart. Among 810 persons who were eligible for imaging at baseline, longitudinal imaging data were available for 501 persons (mean age, 69.9 years; age range, 64.1-91.1 years). Changes in normal-appearing white matter {DTI} characteristics in the tract centers were analyzed globally to investigate diffuse patterns of change and then locally by using voxelwise multilinear regression. The influence of cardiovascular risk factors was assessed by treating them as additional determinants in both analyses.
{RESULTS}: Over the 2.0-year follow-up interval, global fractional anisotropy ({FA}) decreased by 0.0042 (P {\textless} .001), while mean diffusivity ({MD}) increased by 8.1 × 10(-6) mm(2)/sec (P {\textless} .001). Voxelwise analysis of the brain white matter skeleton showed an average decrease of 0.0082 (Pmean = .002) in {FA} in 57\% of skeleton voxels. The sensorimotor pathway, however, showed an increase of 0.0078 (Pmean = .009) in {FA}. {MD} increased by 10.8 × 10(-6)mm(2)/sec (Pmean {\textless} .001) on average in 79\% of white matter skeleton voxels. Additionally, white matter degeneration was more pronounced in older persons. Cardiovascular risk factors were generally not associated with longitudinal changes in white matter microstructure.
{CONCLUSION}: Longitudinal diffusion analysis indicates widespread microstructural deterioration of the normal-appearing white matter in normal aging, with relative sparing of sensorimotor fibers.},

The microstructural basis of white matter maturation and aging can be investigated using diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}). Generally, diffusion anisotropy increases during childhood and adolescence followed by a decline in middle age. However, this process is subject to spatial variations between tracts. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent age-related variations also occur within tracts. {DTI} parameters were compared between segments of two white matter tracts, the cingulate bundle ({CB}) and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus ({IFO}), in 257 healthy individuals between 13 and 84years of age. Segments of the {CB} and the {IFO} were extracted and parameters for each segment were averaged across the hemispheres. The data was analysed as a function of age. Results show that age-related changes differ both between and within individual tracts. Different age trajectories were observed in all segments of the analysed tracts for all {DTI} parameters. In conclusion, aging does not affect white matter tracts uniformly but is regionally specific; both between and within white matter tracts.},

Cortical thickness was estimated as the distance between the gray/white boundary and the outer cortical surface, resulting in a continuous estimate across the cortical mantle. Global thinning was apparent by middle age. Men and women showed a similar degree of global thinning, and did not differ in mean thickness in the younger or older groups. Age-associated differences were widespread but demonstrated a patchwork of regional atrophy and sparing. Examination of subsets of the data from independent samples produced highly similar age-associated patterns of atrophy, suggesting that the specific anatomic patterns within the maps were reliable. Certain results, including prominent atrophy of prefrontal cortex and relative sparing of temporal and parahippocampal cortex, converged with previous findings. Other results were unexpected, such as the finding of prominent atrophy in frontal cortex near primary motor cortex and calcarine cortex near primary visual cortex. These findings demonstrate that cortical thinning occurs by middle age and spans widespread cortical regions that include primary as well as association cortex.},

We quantified longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) scans of 92 nondemented older adults (age 59-85 years at baseline) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging to determine the rates and regional distribution of gray and white matter tissue loss in older adults. Using images from baseline, 2 year, and 4 year follow-up, we found significant age changes in gray (p {\textless} 0.001) and white (p {\textless} 0.001) volumes even in a subgroup of 24 very healthy elderly. Annual rates of tissue loss were 5.4 +/- 0.3, 2.4 +/- 0.4, and 3.1 +/- 0.4 cm3 per year for total brain, gray, and white volumes, respectively, and ventricles increased by 1.4 +/- 0.1 cm3 per year (3.7, 1.3, 2.4, and 1.2 cm3, respectively, in very healthy). Frontal and parietal, compared with temporal and occipital, lobar regions showed greater decline. Gray matter loss was most pronounced for orbital and inferior frontal, cingulate, insular, inferior parietal, and to a lesser extent mesial temporal regions, whereas white matter changes were widespread. In this first study of gray and white matter volume changes, we demonstrate significant longitudinal tissue loss for both gray and white matter even in very healthy older adults. These data provide essential information on the rate and regional pattern of age-associated changes against which pathology can be evaluated and suggest slower rates of brain atrophy in individuals who remain medically and cognitively healthy.},

	abstract = {Normal volunteers, aged 30 to 99 years, were studied with {MRI}. Age was related to estimated volumes of: gray matter, white matter, and {CSF} of the cerebrum and cerebellum; gray matter, white matter, white matter abnormality, and {CSF} within each cerebral lobe; and gray matter of eight subcortical structures. The results were: 1) Age-related losses in the hippocampus were significantly accelerated relative to gray matter losses elsewhere in the brain. 2) Among the cerebral lobes, the frontal lobes were disproportionately affected by cortical volume loss and increased white matter abnormality. 3) Loss of cerebral and cerebellar white matter occurred later than, but was ultimately greater than, loss of gray matter. It is estimated that between the ages of 30 and 90 volume loss averages 14\% in the cerebral cortex, 35\% in the hippocampus, and 26\% in the cerebral white matter. Separate analyses were conducted in which genetic risk associated with the Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele was either overrepresented or underrepresented among elderly participants. Accelerated loss of hippocampal volume was observed with both analyses and thus does not appear to be due to the presence of at-risk subjects. {MR} signal alterations in the tissues of older individuals pose challenges to the validity of current methods of tissue segmentation, and should be considered in the interpretation of the results.},

	shorttitle = {Accelerated Brain Aging in Schizophrenia},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Despite the multitude of longitudinal neuroimaging studies that have been published, a basic question on the progressive brain loss in schizophrenia remains unaddressed: Does it reflect accelerated aging of the brain, or is it caused by a fundamentally different process? The authors used support vector regression, a supervised machine learning technique, to address this question.
{METHOD}: In a longitudinal sample of 341 schizophrenia patients and 386 healthy subjects with one or more structural {MRI} scans (1,197 in total), machine learning algorithms were used to build models to predict the age of the brain and the presence of schizophrenia ("schizophrenia score"), based on the gray matter density maps. Age at baseline ranged from 16 to 67 years, and follow-up scans were acquired between 1 and 13 years after the baseline scan. Differences between brain age and chronological age ("brain age gap") and between schizophrenia score and healthy reference score ("schizophrenia gap") were calculated. Accelerated brain aging was calculated from changes in brain age gap between two consecutive measurements. The age prediction model was validated in an independent sample.
{RESULTS}: In schizophrenia patients, brain age was significantly greater than chronological age at baseline (+3.36 years) and progressively increased during follow-up (+1.24 years in addition to the baseline gap). The acceleration of brain aging was not constant: it decreased from 2.5 years/year just after illness onset to about the normal rate (1 year/year) approximately 5 years after illness onset. The schizophrenia gap also increased during follow-up, but more pronounced variability in brain abnormalities at follow-up rendered this increase nonsignificant.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The progressive brain loss in schizophrenia appears to reflect two different processes: one relatively homogeneous, reflecting accelerated aging of the brain and related to various measures of outcome, and a more variable one, possibly reflecting individual variation and medication use. Differentiating between these two processes may not only elucidate the various factors influencing brain loss in schizophrenia, but also assist in individualizing treatment.},

	doi = {10.1002/ana.24367},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The long-term effects of traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) can resemble observed in normal ageing, suggesting that {TBI} may accelerate the ageing process. We investigate this using a neuroimaging model that predicts brain age in healthy individuals and then apply it to {TBI} patients. We define individuals' differences in chronological and predicted structural "brain age," and test whether {TBI} produces progressive atrophy and how this relates to cognitive function.
{METHODS}: A predictive model of normal ageing was defined using machine learning in 1,537 healthy individuals, based on magnetic resonance imaging-derived estimates of gray matter ({GM}) and white matter ({WM}). This ageing model was then applied to test 99 {TBI} patients and 113 healthy controls to estimate brain age.
{RESULTS}: The initial model accurately predicted age in healthy individuals (r = 0.92). {TBI} brains were estimated to be "older," with a mean predicted age difference ({PAD}) between chronological and estimated brain age of 4.66 years (±10.8) for {GM} and 5.97 years (±11.22) for {WM}. This {PAD} predicted cognitive impairment and correlated strongly with the time since {TBI}, indicating that brain tissue loss increases throughout the chronic postinjury phase.
{INTERPRETATION}: {TBI} patients' brains were estimated to be older than their chronological age. This discrepancy increases with time since injury, suggesting that {TBI} accelerates the rate of brain atrophy. This may be an important factor in the increased susceptibility in {TBI} patients for dementia and other age-associated conditions, motivating further research into the age-like effects of brain injury and other neurological diseases.},

We used latent variable modeling to extract error-free cognitive levels and slopes. Initial levels of cognitive ability were predictive of subsequent brain tissue volume changes. Initial brain volumes were not predictive of subsequent cognitive changes. Brain volume changes, especially increases in {WMH}, were associated with declines in each of the cognitive abilities. All statistically significant results were modest in size (absolute r-values ranged from 0.114 to 0.334).

Speed was a key construct for all 3 types of memory tasks, mediating substantial age-related variance; working memory was a fundamental construct for free and cued recall but not spatial memory.

The initial formation of tangles and plaques in healthy aging appeared to be independent of each other. Tangles were found in all the nondemented cases, especially in hippocampal and parahippocampal areas; the average tangle concentration increased exponentially with age. In contrast, plaques were absent in some brains up to age 88, and the earliest plaque formation in other cases occurred in the neocortex, in patches of diffuse plaques. Widely distributed neuritic as well as diffuse plaques throughout neocortex and limbic structures characterized a further group of nondemented cases. In these cases there was also a substantial increase over other nondemented cases, both in the number of tangles and in the rate of increase in tangles with age, suggesting an interaction between amyloid and neurofibrillary change at this stage.

Originally, the decline was attributed to a loss of cortical neurons, but recent studies have shown there is no significant cortical neuronal loss with age. Neurons acquire pigment, but the only other obvious changes are in layer 1 of neocortex. Layer 1 becomes thinner as apical tufts of pyramidal cells lose branches, as well as synapses, and at the same time the glial limiting membrane thickens. How dendrites and synapses in deep layers are affected by age is uncertain, but there are decreases in the levels of some neurotransmitters and receptors. Throughout the brain myelin sheaths show signs of breakdown. This may contribute to cognitive decline because it would cause a slowing of conduction along nerve fibers, disrupting the timing in neuronal circuits. Concomitantly, the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes develop swellings along their processes and gain dense inclusions. Microglial cells and astrocytes accumulate large amounts of phagocytosed material with age, although the origins of this material are not known.},

	abstract = {The concept of frailty as a medically distinct syndrome has evolved based on the clinical experience of geriatricians and is clinically well recognizable. Frailty is a nonspecific state of vulnerability, which reflects multisystem physiological change. These changes underlying frailty do not always achieve disease status, so some people, usually very elderly, are frail without a specific life threatening illness. Current thinking is that not only physical but also psychological, cognitive and social factors contribute to this syndrome and need to be taken into account in its definition and treatment. Together, these signs and symptoms seem to reflect a reduced functional reserve and consequent decrease in adaptation (resilience) to any sort of stressor and perhaps even in the absence of extrinsic stressors. The overall consequence is that frail elderly are at higher risk for accelerated physical and cognitive decline, disability and death. All these characteristics associated with frailty can easily be applied to the definition and characterization of the aging process per se and there is little consensus in the literature concerning the physiological/biological pathways associated with or determining frailty. It is probably true to say that a consensus view would implicate heightened chronic systemic inflammation as a major contributor to frailty. This review will focus on the relationship between aging, frailty and age-related diseases, and will highlight possible interventions to reduce the occurrence and effects of frailty in elderly people.},

The biological age ({BA}), which combines several important biomarkers with mathematical modeling, has been proposed for {\textgreater}50 years as an aging estimation method to replace chronological age ({CA}). The common methods used for {BA} estimation include the multiple linear regression ({MLR}), the principal component analysis ({PCA}), the Hochschild's method, and the Klemera and Doubal's method ({KDM}). The fundamental differences in these four methods are the roles of {CA} and the selection criteria of aging biomarkers. In {MLR} and {PCA}, {CA} is treated as the selection criterion and an independent index. The Hochschild's method and {KDM} share a similar concept, making {CA} an independent variable. Previous studies have either simply constructed the {BA} model by one or compared the four methods together. However, reviews have yet to illustrate and compare the four methods systematically. Since the {BA} model is a potential estimation of aging for clinical use, such as predicting onset and prognosis of diseases, improving the elderly's living qualities, and realizing successful aging, here we summarize previous {BA} studies, illustrate the basic statistical steps, and thoroughly discuss the comparisons among the four common {BA} estimation methods.},

This paper reviews key findings from ageing twin cohorts probing these questions. Twin studies are the perfect natural experiment to dissect out genes and life experiences. We discuss the paradox that ageing is strongly determined by heritable factors (an influence that often gets stronger with time), yet longevity and lifespan seem not to be so heritable. We then focus on the intriguing question of why {DNA} sequence-identical twins might age differently. Animal studies are increasingly showing that epigenetic modifications occurring in early development and adulthood, might be key to ageing phenomena but this is difficult to investigate longitudinally in human populations, due to ethical problems of intervention and long lifespan. We propose that identical twin studies using new and existing cohorts may be useful human models in which to investigate the interaction between the environment and genetics, mediated by epigenetic modifications.},

In this article, the qualitative and quantitative differences between aging and Alzheimer's disease with respect to neuron loss are discussed, and age-related changes in functional and biochemical attributes of hippocampal circuits that might mediate functional decline in the absence of neuron death are explored.

Collins et al., 1998, Trans. Med. Imag. 17, 463-468) was performed. The {MNI} single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest ({AVOI}) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution {MNI} single subject. The 90 {AVOI} were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the {AVOI} intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the {AVOI} intersected by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package ({SPM}, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum. Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps.},

{METHODS}: We analyzed task-free-{fMRI} data with both independent component analysis and seed-based analysis to identify anterior and posterior {DMNs}. We investigated age-related changes in connectivity in a sample of 341 cognitively normal subjects. We then compared 28 patients with {AD} with 56 cognitively normal noncarriers of the {APOE} ε4 allele matched for age, education, and gender.
{RESULTS}: The anterior {DMN} shows age-associated increases and decreases in fontal lobe connectivity, whereas the posterior {DMN} shows mainly age-associated declines in connectivity throughout. Relative to matched cognitively normal controls, subjects with {AD} display an accelerated pattern of the age-associated changes described above, except that the declines in frontal lobe connectivity did not reach statistical significance. These changes survive atrophy correction and are correlated with cognitive performance.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The results of this study indicate that the {DMN} abnormalities observed in patients with {AD} represent an accelerated aging pattern of connectivity compared with matched controls.},

The sequencing of the human genome, and advances in molecular biology, have illuminated the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases and have propelled our knowledge of how the brain controls behavior.To grasp the wider implications of these developments and gain a fundamental understanding of this dynamic, fast-moving field, Principles of Neuroscience stands alone as the most authoritative and indispensible resource of its kind.In this classic text, prominent researchers in the field expertly survey the entire spectrum of neural science, giving an up-to-date, unparalleled view of the discipline for anyone who studies brain and mind. Here, in one remarkable volume, is the current state of neural science knowledge―ranging from molecules and cells, to anatomic structures and systems, to the senses and cognitive functions―all supported by more than 900 precise, full-color illustrations. In addition to clarifying complex topics, the book also benefits from a cohesive organization, beginning with an insightful overview of the interrelationships between the brain, nervous system, genes, and behavior. Principles of Neural Science then proceeds with an in-depth examination of the molecular and cellular biology of nerve cells, synaptic transmission, and the neural basis of cognition. The remaining sections illuminate how cells, molecules, and systems give us sight, hearing, touch, movement, thought, learning, memories, and emotions.The new fifth edition of Principles of Neural Science is thoroughly updated to reflect the tremendous amount of research, and the very latest clinical perspectives, that have significantly transformed the field within the last decade.Ultimately, Principles of Neural Science affirms that all behavior is an expression of neural activity, and that the future of clinical neurology and psychiatry hinges on the progress of neural science. Far exceeding the scope and scholarship of similar texts, this unmatched guide offers a commanding, scientifically rigorous perspective on the molecular mechanisms of neural function and disease―one that you’ll continually rely on to advance your comprehension of brain, mind, and behavior.{FEATURESThe} cornerstone reference in the field of neuroscience that explains how the nerves, brain, and mind {functionClear} emphasis on how behavior can be examined through the electrical activity of both individual neurons and systems of nerve {cellsCurrent} focus on molecular biology as a tool for probing the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases, including muscular dystrophy, Huntington disease, and certain forms of Alzheimer’s {diseaseMore} than 900 engaging full-color illustrations―including line drawings, radiographs, micrographs, and medical photographs clarify often-complex neuroscience {conceptsOutstanding} section on the development and emergence of behavior, including important coverage of brain damage repair, the sexual differentiation of the nervous system, and the aging {brainNEW}!

We used a modified stop-signal task involving coupled bimanual responses and manipulated whether both or just one hand was cued to stop. Stop-task difficulty was matched across groups. We found a group by condition interaction in supramarginal gyrus, anterior insula, {rIFC}, and {preSMA}, with activation increasing for successful Stop versus Go trials in the young adults only. Comparing the groups on Stop trials revealed {preSMA} and striatum hypoactivity for older adults. White matter tracts connecting {rIFC}, {preSMA}, and the subthalamic nuclei were associated with stronger activation of {preSMA} in older adults, suggesting that maintenance of the brain's structure has positive implications for brain function.},

A visual cue signaled the right hand to Switch or Continue its circling direction. Switching from mirror symmetric to asymmetric ({SW}»{ASYMM}) took longer and resulted in more contralateral (left-) hand disruptions than vice versa. These effects were more pronounced in the elderly, showing that the ability to suppress and flexibly adapt motor behavior (agility) declines with age.

A region of interest analysis revealed significantly reduced {SW}»{ASYMM} activation in bilateral subthalamic nucleus and right globus pallidus, only in the elderly.

This premise is supported by the observation of anterior striatum activation in functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) analyses that focus on uncertain versus certain Go trials. It is assumed that setting up a proactive inhibitory task set also influences how participants subsequently implement stopping. To assess this assumption, we aimed to manipulate the degree of proactive inhibition in a modified stop-signal task to see how this manipulation influences activation when reacting to the Stop cue. Specifically, we tested whether there is differential activity of basal ganglia nuclei, namely the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) and anterior striatum, on Stop trials when stop-signal probability was relatively low (20\%) or high (40\%). Successful stopping was associated with increased {STN} activity when Stop trials were infrequent and increased caudate head activation when Stop trials were more likely, suggesting a different implementation of reactive response inhibition by the basal ganglia for differing degrees of proactive response control.

Traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) patients show clear impairments in this type of action control; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we tested whether white matter integrity of cortico-subcortical pathways could account for impairments in task switching, an important component of executive functioning. Twenty young adults with {TBI} and eighteen controls performed a switching task requiring attention to global versus local stimulus features. Diffusion weighted images were acquired and whole brain tract-based spatial statistics ({TBSS}) were used to explore where white matter damage was associated with switching impairment. A crossing fiber model and probabilistic tractography further identified the specific fiber populations. Relative to controls, patients with a history of {TBI} had a higher switch cost and were less accurate. The {TBI} group showed a widespread decline in fractional anisotropy ({FA}) throughout the {TBSS} skeleton. {FA} in the superior corona radiata showed a negative relationship with switch cost. More specifically, this involved cortico-subcortical loops with the (pre-)supplementary motor area and superior frontal gyrus.

Whereas executive dysfunction has traditionally been associated with prefrontal lesions, ample evidence suggests that those functions requiring behavioral flexibility critically depend on the interaction between frontal cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus. To test whether structural integrity of this fronto-striato-thalamic circuit can account for executive impairments in {TBI} we automatically segmented the thalamus, putamen and caudate of 25 patients and 21 healthy controls and obtained diffusion weighted images. We assessed components of executive function using the local-global task, which requires inhibition, updating and switching between actions. Shape analysis revealed localized atrophy of the limbic, executive and rostral-motor zones of the basal ganglia, whereas atrophy of the thalami was more global in {TBI}. This subcortical atrophy was related to white matter microstructural organization in {TBI}, suggesting that axonal injuries possibly contribute to subcortical volume loss. Global volume of the nuclei showed no clear relationship with task performance. However, the shape analysis revealed that participants with smaller volume of those subregions that have connections with the prefrontal cortex and rostral motor areas showed higher switch costs and mixing costs, and made more errors while switching. These results support the idea that flexible cognitive control over action depends on interactions within the fronto-striato-thalamic circuit.},

	abstract = {Diffusion weighted imaging ({DWI}) studies in humans have shown that seniors exhibit reduced white matter integrity compared with young adults, with the most pronounced change occurring in frontal white matter. It is generally assumed that this structural deterioration underlies inhibitory control deficits in old age, but specific evidence from a structural neuroscience perspective is lacking. Cognitive action control is thought to rely on an interconnected network consisting of right inferior frontal cortex (r-{IFC}), pre-supplementary motor area ({preSMA}), and the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}). Here we performed probabilistic {DWI} tractography to delineate this cognitive control network and had the same individuals (20 young, 20 older adults) perform a task probing both response inhibition and action reprogramming. We hypothesized that structural integrity (fractional anisotropy) and connection strength within this network would be predictive of individual and age-related differences in task performance. We show that the integrity of r-{IFC} white matter is an age-independent predictor of stop-signal reaction time ({SSRT}). We further provide evidence that the integrity of white matter projecting to {STN} predicts both outright stopping ({SSRT}) and transient braking of response initiation to buy time for action reprogramming (stopping interference effects). These associations remain even after controlling for Go task performance, demonstrating specificity to the Stop component of this task. Finally, a multiple regression analysis reveals bilateral {preSMA}-{STN} tract strength as a significant predictor of {SSRT} in older adults.

Here, we used a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weighted imaging tractography to study changes in brain function and structure associated with motor switching performance in {TBI}. Twenty-three young adults with moderate-severe {TBI} and twenty-six healthy controls made spatially and temporally coupled bimanual circular movements. A visual cue signaled the right hand to switch or continue its circling direction. The time to initiate the switch (switch response time) was longer and more variable in the {TBI} group and {TBI} patients exhibited a higher incidence of complete contralateral (left hand) movement disruptions. Both groups activated the basal ganglia and a previously described network for task-set implementation, including the supplementary motor complex and bilateral inferior frontal cortex ({IFC}). Relative to controls, patients had significantly increased activation in the presupplementary motor area ({preSMA}) and left {IFC}, and showed underactivation of the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) region. This altered functional engagement was related to the white matter microstructural properties of the tracts connecting {preSMA}, {IFC}, and {STN}. Both functional activity in {preSMA}, {IFC}, and {STN}, and the integrity of the connections between them were associated with behavioral performance across patients and controls.

The thalamus, putamen, caudate and pallidum of 91 participants across the adult lifespan (ages 20-79 years) were automatically segmented. In addition to studying age-related changes in the global volume of each subcortical structure, local deformations within these structures, indicative of subregional volume changes, were assessed by means of recently developed shape analyses. Results showed widespread age-related global and subregional atrophy, as well as some notable subregional expansion. Even though global atrophy failed to explain the observed performance declines with aging, shape analyses indicated that atrophy in left and right thalamic subregions, specifically subserving connectivity with the premotor, primary motor and somatosensory cortical areas, mediated the relation between aging and performance decline. It is concluded that subregional volume assessment by means of shape analyses offers a sensitive tool with high anatomical resolution in the search for specific age-related associations between brain structure and behavior.},

Brain-predicted age was calculated using machine-learning analysis, trained on neuroimaging data from a large healthy reference sample (N=2001), then tested in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (N=669), to determine relationships with age-associated functional measures and mortality. Having a brain-predicted age indicative of an older-appearing brain was associated with: weaker grip strength, poorer lung function, slower walking speed, lower fluid intelligence, higher allostatic load and increased mortality risk. Furthermore, while combining brain-predicted age with grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes (themselves strong predictors) not did improve mortality risk prediction, the combination of brain-predicted age and {DNA}-methylation-predicted age did. This indicates that neuroimaging and epigenetics measures of ageing can provide complementary data regarding health outcomes. Our study introduces a clinically-relevant neuroimaging ageing biomarker and demonstrates that combining distinct measurements of biological ageing further helps to determine risk of age-related deterioration and death.},

	abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

Design Metaepidemiological study.
Eligibility criteria Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials with mortality outcomes comparing the effectiveness of exercise and drug interventions with each other or with control (placebo or usual care).
Data sources Medline and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, May 2013.
Main outcome measure Mortality.
Data synthesis We combined study level death outcomes from exercise and drug trials using random effects network meta-analysis.
Results We included 16 (four exercise and 12 drug) meta-analyses. Incorporating an additional three recent exercise trials, our review collectively included 305 randomised controlled trials with 339 274 participants. Across all four conditions with evidence on the effectiveness of exercise on mortality outcomes (secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, rehabilitation of stroke, treatment of heart failure, prevention of diabetes), 14 716 participants were randomised to physical activity interventions in 57 trials. No statistically detectable differences were evident between exercise and drug interventions in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and prediabetes. Physical activity interventions were more effective than drug treatment among patients with stroke (odds ratios, exercise v anticoagulants 0.09, 95\% credible intervals 0.01 to 0.70 and exercise v antiplatelets 0.10, 0.01 to 0.62). Diuretics were more effective than exercise in heart failure (exercise v diuretics 4.11, 1.17 to 24.76). Inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons was not significant.
Conclusions Although limited in quantity, existing randomised trial evidence on exercise interventions suggests that exercise and many drug interventions are often potentially similar in terms of their mortality benefits in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, rehabilitation after stroke, treatment of heart failure, and prevention of diabetes.},

{METHODS}: We prospectively examined physical activity guidelines in relation to mortality among 252,925 women and men aged 50 to 71 years in the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons ({NIH}-{AARP}) Diet and Health Study. Physical activity was assessed using 2 self-administered baseline questionnaires.
{RESULTS}: During 1,265,347 person-years of follow-up, 7,900 participants died. Compared with being inactive, achievement of activity levels that approximate the recommendations for moderate activity (at least 30 minutes on most days of the week) or vigorous exercise (at least 20 minutes 3 times per week) was associated with a 27\% (relative risk [{RR}], 0.73; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.68-0.78) and 32\% ({RR}, 0.68; 95\% {CI}, 0.64-0.73) decreased mortality risk, respectively. Physical activity reflective of meeting both recommendations was related to substantially decreased mortality risk overall ({RR}, 0.50; 95\% {CI}, 0.46-0.54) and in subgroups, including smokers ({RR}, 0.48; 95\% {CI}, 0.44-0.53) and nonsmokers ({RR}, 0.54; 95\% {CI}, 0.45-0.64), normal weight ({RR}, 0.45; 95\% {CI}, 0.39-0.52) and overweight or obese individuals ({RR}, 0.48; 95\% {CI}, 0.44-0.54), and those with 2 h/d ({RR}, 0.53; 95\% {CI}, 0.44-0.63) and more than 2 h/d of television or video watching ({RR}, 0.50; 95\% {CI}, 0.45-0.55). Engaging in physical activity at less than recommended levels was also related to reduced mortality risk ({RR}, 0.81; 95\% {CI}, 0.76-0.86).

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the association with all-cause mortality of different domains of physical activity and of defined increases in physical activity and energy expenditure.
{METHODS}: {MEDLINE}, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched up to September 2010 for cohort studies examining all-cause mortality across different domains and levels of physical activity in adult general populations. We estimated combined risk ratios ({RRs}) associated with defined increments and recommended levels, using random-effects meta-analysis and dose-response meta-regression models.
{RESULTS}: Data from 80 studies with 1 338 143 participants (118 121 deaths) were included. Combined {RRs} comparing highest with lowest activity levels were 0.65 [95\% confidence interval (95\% {CI}) 0.60-0.71] for total activity, 0.74 (95\% {CI} 0.70-0.77) for leisure activity, 0.64 (95\% {CI} 0.55-0.75) for activities of daily living and 0.83 (95\% {CI} 0.71-0.97) for occupational activity. {RRs} per 1-h increment per week were 0.91 (95\% {CI} 0.87-0.94) for vigorous exercise and 0.96 (95\% {CI} 0.93-0.98) for moderate-intensity activities of daily living. {RRs} corresponding to 150 and 300 min/week of moderate to vigorous activity were 0.86 (95\% {CI} 0.80-0.92) and 0.74 (95\% {CI} 0.65-0.85), respectively. Mortality reductions were more pronounced in women.
{CONCLUSION}: Higher levels of total and domain-specific physical activity were associated with reduced all-cause mortality. Risk reduction per unit of time increase was largest for vigorous exercise. Moderate-intensity activities of daily living were to a lesser extent beneficial in reducing mortality.},

The magnitude of risk reduction with exercise, diet, lipid modification, and smoking cessation is similar to other medical therapies for coronary disease such as aspirin, beta blockers, as well as coronary bypass surgery, (Table {VI}) In contrast to these therapies, however, secondary prevention stabilizes angiographic progression in about 50\% of patients and induces regression in about 25\% of patients. Both symptoms and perceived quality of life also are beneficially altered by secondary prevention programs, although possibly not by the magnitude reported for bypass surgery. These clinical trial results have led the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology to strongly endorse secondary prevention. A reasonable projection based on these clinical trial data is that widespread use of these recommendations in the 12 million established coronary disease patients would significantly reduce coronary mortality and morbidity.},

It is likely that increases in life expectancy at older ages will continue, but life expectancy at birth is unlikely to reach levels above 95 unless there is a fundamental change in our ability to delay the aging process. We have yet to experience much compression of morbidity as the age of onset of most health problems has not increased markedly. In recent decades, there have been some reductions in the prevalence of physical disability and dementia. At the same time, the prevalence of disease has increased markedly, in large part due to treatment which extends life for those with disease. Compressing morbidity or increasing the relative healthspan will require "delaying aging" or delaying the physiological change that results in disease and disability. While moving to life expectancies above age 95 and compressing morbidity substantially may require significant scientific breakthroughs; significant improvement in health and increases in life expectancy in the United States could be achieved with behavioral, life style, and policy changes that reduce socioeconomic disparities and allow us to reach the levels of health and life expectancy achieved in peer societies.},

	abstract = {Age-related neurodegenerative and neurochemical changes are thought to underlie decline in motor and cognitive functions, but compensatory processes in cortical and subcortical function may allow maintenance of performance level in some people. Our objective was to investigate age-related changes in the motor system of the human brain using functional {MRI}. Twenty six right handed volunteers were scanned whilst performing an isometric, dynamic, visually paced hand grip task, using dominant (right) and non-dominant (left) hands in separate sessions. Hand grip with visual feedback activated a network of cortical and subcortical regions known to be involved in the generation of simple motor acts. In addition, activation was seen in a putative human 'grasping circuit', involving rostral ventral premotor cortex (Brodmann area 44) and intraparietal sulcus. Within this network, a number of regions were more likely to be activated the older the subject. In particular, age-related changes in task- specific activations were demonstrated in left deep anterior central sulcus when using the dominant or non-dominant hand. Additional age-related increases were seen in caudal dorsal premotor cortex, caudal cingulate sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, insula, frontal operculum and cerebellar vermis. We have demonstrated a clear age-related effect in the neural correlates of motor performance, and furthermore suggest that these changes are non-linear. These results support the notion that an adaptable and plastic motor network is able to respond to age-related degenerative changes in order to maintain performance levels.},

{OBJECTIVE}: To delineate age-related changes in the physiology of brain systems subserving simple motor behavior.
{METHODS}: Ten strongly right-handed young ({\textless}35 years of age) and 12 strongly right-handed elderly ({\textgreater}50 years of age) subjects with no evidence of cognitive or motor deficits participated in the study. Whole-brain functional imaging was performed on a 1.5-T {MRI} scanner using a spiral pulse sequence while the subjects performed a visually paced "button-press" motor task with their dominant right hand alternating with a rest state.
{RESULTS}: Although the groups did not differ in accuracy, there was an increase in reaction time in the elderly subjects (mean score plus minus {SD}, young subjects = 547 +/- 97 ms, elderly subjects = 794 +/- 280 ms, p {\textless} 0.03). There was a greater extent of activation in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, lateral premotor area, supplementary motor area, and ipsilateral cerebellum in the elderly subjects relative to the young subjects (p {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {Healthy aging ({HA}) is associated with certain declines in cognitive functions, even in individuals that are free of any process of degenerative illness. Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) has been widely used in order to link this age-related cognitive decline with patterns of altered brain function. A consistent finding in the {fMRI} literature is that healthy old adults present higher activity levels in some brain regions during the performance of cognitive tasks. This finding is usually interpreted as a compensatory mechanism. More recent approaches have focused on the study of functional connectivity, mainly derived from resting state {fMRI}, and have concluded that the higher levels of activity coexist with disrupted connectivity. In this review, we aim to provide a state-of-the-art description of the usefulness and the interpretations of functional brain connectivity in the context of {HA}. We first give a background that includes some basic aspects and methodological issues regarding functional connectivity. We summarize the main findings and the cognitive models that have been derived from task-activity studies, and we then review the findings provided by resting-state functional connectivity in {HA}. Finally, we suggest some future directions in this field of research. A common finding of the studies included is that older subjects present reduced functional connectivity compared to young adults. This reduced connectivity affects the main brain networks and explains age-related cognitive alterations. Remarkably, the default mode network appears as a highly compromised system in {HA}. Overall, the scenario given by both activity and connectivity studies also suggests that the trajectory of changes during task may differ from those observed during resting-state. We propose that the use of complex modeling approaches studying effective connectivity may help to understand context-dependent functional reorganizations in the aging process.},

Furthermore, there was a highly significant positive correlation between total activation for ipsilateral M1 and age, and a nearly significant trend for contralateral M1. This study documents that during execution of a simple paced motor task, the older the subject the less lateralized the M1 activation balance as a result of increasing amount of activation on both sides, more significantly so ipsilaterally. Thus, in aging, enhanced M1 recruitment bilaterally is required to produce the same motor performance, suggesting a compensatory process. These findings are in line with cognitive studies indicating a tendency for the aging brain to reduce its functional lateralization, perhaps from less efficient transcallosal connections.},

Frontal regions active in younger adults during self-initiated (intentional) memory encoding were under-recruited in older adults. Older adults showed less activity in anterior-ventral regions associated with controlled use of semantic information. Under-recruitment was reversed by requiring semantic elaboration suggesting it stemmed from difficulty in spontaneous recruitment of available frontal resources. In addition, older adults recruited multiple frontal regions in a nonselective manner for both verbal and nonverbal materials. Lack of selectivity was not reversed during semantically directed encoding even when under-recruitment was diminished. These findings suggest two separate forms of age-associated change in frontal cortex: under-recruitment and nonselective recruitment. The former is reversible and potentially amenable to cognitive training; the latter may reflect a less malleable change associated with cognitive decline in advanced aging.},

Here, we investigated whether this age-related overactivation reflects compensation or dedifferentiation mechanisms. “Compensation” refers to additional activation that counteracts age-related decline of brain function and supports successful performance, whereas “dedifferentiation” reflects age-related difficulties in recruiting specialized neural mechanisms and is not relevant to task performance. To test these predictions, performance on a complex interlimb coordination task was correlated with brain activation. Findings revealed that coordination resulted in activation of classical motor coordination regions, but also higher-level sensorimotor regions, and frontal regions in the elderly. Interestingly, a positive correlation between activation level in these latter regions and motor performance was observed in the elderly. This performance enhancing additional recruitment is consistent with the compensation hypothesis and characterizes neuroplasticity at the systems level in the aging brain.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Available data indicate a decline in fine finger movements with aging, suggesting changes in central motor processes. Thus far no functional neuroimaging study has assessed the effect of age on activation patterns during finger movement.
{METHODS}: We used high-resolution perfusion positron emission tomography to study 2 groups of 7 healthy right-handed subjects each: a young group (mean age, 24 years) and an old group (mean age, 60 years). The task was a thumb-to-index tapping, auditory-cued at 1. 26 Hz with a metronome, with either the right or the left hand. The control condition was a resting state with the metronome on.
{RESULTS}: Significant differences between old and young subjects were found, suggesting significant overactivation in older subjects affecting the superior frontal cortex (premotor-prefrontal junction) ipsilateral to the moving fingers, as if the execution of this apparently simple motor task was judged more complex by the aged brain. Similar findings in previous perceptual and cognitive paradigms have been interpreted as a compensation process for the neurobiological changes of aging. Analysis of the control condition data in our sample showed, however, that this prefrontal overactivation in the old group was due at least in part to higher resting perfusion in anterior brain areas in the young subjects.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The changes in brain function observed in this study may underlie the subtle decline in fine motor functions known to occur with normal aging. Our findings emphasize the importance of using an age-matched control group in functional imaging studies of motor recovery after stroke.},

	abstract = {Whereas some older adults show significant cognitive deficits, others perform as well as young adults. We investigated the neural basis of these different aging patterns using positron emission tomography ({PET}). In {PET} and functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) studies, prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) activity tends to be less asymmetric in older than in younger adults (Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Old Adults or {HAROLD}). This change may help counteract age-related neurocognitive decline (compensation hypothesis) or it may reflect an age-related difficulty in recruiting specialized neural mechanisms (dedifferentiation hypothesis). To compare these two hypotheses, we measured {PFC} activity in younger adults, low-performing older adults, and high-performing older adults during recall and source memory of recently studied words. Compared to recall, source memory was associated with right {PFC} activations in younger adults. Low-performing older adults recruited similar right {PFC} regions as young adults, but high-performing older adults engaged {PFC} regions bilaterally. Thus, consistent with the compensation hypothesis and inconsistent with the dedifferentiation hypothesis, a hemispheric asymmetry reduction was found in high-performing but not in low-performing older adults. The results suggest that low-performing older adults recruited a similar network as young adults but used it inefficiently, whereas high-performing older adults counteracted age-related neural decline through a plastic reorganization of neurocognitive networks.},

Therefore, we investigated whether patients with {SZ} (N = 141), major depression ({MD}; N = 104), borderline personality disorder ({BPD}; N = 57), and individuals in at-risk mental states for psychosis ({ARMS}; N = 89) deviated from the trajectory of normal brain maturation. This deviation was measured as difference between chronological and the neuroanatomical age (brain age gap estimation [{BrainAGE}]). Neuroanatomical age was determined by a machine learning system trained to individually estimate age from the structural magnetic resonance imagings of 800 healthy controls. Group-level analyses showed that {BrainAGE} was highest in {SZ} (+5.5 y) group, followed by {MD} (+4.0), {BPD} (+3.1), and the {ARMS} (+1.7) groups. Earlier disease onset in {MD} and {BPD} groups correlated with more pronounced {BrainAGE}, reaching effect sizes of the {SZ} group. Second, {BrainAGE} increased across at-risk, recent onset, and recurrent states of {SZ}. Finally, {BrainAGE} predicted both patient status as well as negative and disorganized symptoms. These findings suggest that an individually quantifiable "accelerated aging" effect may particularly impact on the neuroanatomical signature of {SZ} but may extend also to other mental disorders.},

Individual expression of this brain pattern served as a physiologic measure of brain age ({BA}). The difference between {CA} and {BA} was predicted by education and self-report measures of physical activity. Education and the daily number of flights of stairs climbed ({FOSC}) were the only 2 significant predictors of decreased {BA}. Effect sizes demonstrated that {BA} decreased by 0.95 years for each year of education and by 0.58 years for 1 additional {FOSC} daily. Effects of education and {FOSC} on regional brain volume were largely driven by temporal and subcortical volumes. These results demonstrate that higher levels of education and daily {FOSC} are related to larger brain volume than predicted by {CA} which supports the utility of regional gray matter volume as a biomarker of healthy brain aging.},

Specific focus was directed at age fifty and beyond, as mid-life is a time when aging processes are known to become more prominent. We applied a recently developed machine learning algorithm trained to identify anatomical correlates of age in the brain translating those into one single score: the {BrainAGE} index (in years). Using this validated approach based on high-dimensional pattern recognition, we re-analyzed a large sample of 50 long-term meditators and 50 control subjects estimating and comparing their brain ages. We observed that, at age fifty, brains of meditators were estimated to be 7.5 years younger than those of controls. In addition, we examined if the brain age estimates change with increasing age. While brain age estimates varied only little in controls, significant changes were detected in meditators: for every additional year over fifty, meditators' brains were estimated to be an additional 1 month and 22 days younger than their chronological age. Altogether, these findings seem to suggest that meditation is beneficial for brain preservation, effectively protecting against age-related atrophy with a consistently slower rate of brain aging throughout life.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}), the most common form of dementia, shares many aspects of abnormal brain aging. We present a novel magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI})-based biomarker that predicts the individual progression of mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}) to {AD} on the basis of pathological brain aging patterns. By employing kernel regression methods, the expression of normal brain-aging patterns forms the basis to estimate the brain age of a given new subject. If the estimated age is higher than the chronological age, a positive brain age gap estimation ({BrainAGE}) score indicates accelerated atrophy and is considered a risk factor for conversion to {AD}. Here, the {BrainAGE} framework was applied to predict the individual brain ages of 195 subjects with {MCI} at baseline, of which a total of 133 developed {AD} during 36 months of follow-up (corresponding to a pre-test probability of 68\%). The ability of the {BrainAGE} framework to correctly identify {MCI}-converters was compared with the performance of commonly used cognitive scales, hippocampus volume, and state-of-the-art biomarkers derived from cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}). With accuracy rates of up to 81\%, {BrainAGE} outperformed all cognitive scales and {CSF} biomarkers in predicting conversion of {MCI} to {AD} within 3 years of follow-up. Each additional year in the {BrainAGE} score was associated with a 10\% greater risk of developing {AD} (hazard rate: 1.10 [{CI}: 1.07–1.13]). Furthermore, the post-test probability was increased to 90\% when using baseline {BrainAGE} scores to predict conversion to {AD}. The presented framework allows an accurate prediction even with multicenter data. Its fast and fully automated nature facilitates the integration into the clinical workflow. It can be exploited as a tool for screening as well as for monitoring treatment options.},

	abstract = {The early identification of brain anatomy deviating from the normal pattern of growth and atrophy, such as in Alzheimer's disease ({AD}), has the potential to improve clinical outcomes through early intervention. Recently, Davatzikos et al. (2009) supported the hypothesis that pathologic atrophy in {AD} is an accelerated aging process, implying accelerated brain atrophy. In order to recognize faster brain atrophy, a model of healthy brain aging is needed first. Here, we introduce a framework for automatically and efficiently estimating the age of healthy subjects from their T(1)-weighted {MRI} scans using a kernel method for regression. This method was tested on over 650 healthy subjects, aged 19-86 years, and collected from four different scanners. Furthermore, the influence of various parameters on estimation accuracy was analyzed. Our age estimation framework included automatic preprocessing of the T(1)-weighted images, dimension reduction via principal component analysis, training of a relevance vector machine ({RVM}; Tipping, 2000) for regression, and finally estimating the age of the subjects from the test samples. The framework proved to be a reliable, scanner-independent, and efficient method for age estimation in healthy subjects, yielding a correlation of r=0.92 between the estimated and the real age in the test samples and a mean absolute error of 5 years. The results indicated favorable performance of the {RVM} and identified the number of training samples as the critical factor for prediction accuracy. Applying the framework to people with mild {AD} resulted in a mean brain age gap estimate ({BrainAGE}) score of +10 years.},

Personal health markers and modifiable lifestyle factors are related to individual brain aging as well as to the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}). This study uses a novel magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI})-based biomarker to assess the effects of 17 health markers on individual brain aging in cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects. By employing kernel regression methods, the expression of normal brain-aging patterns forms the basis to estimate the brain age of a given new subject. If the estimated age is higher than the chronological age, a positive brain age gap estimation ({BrainAGE}) score indicates accelerated atrophy and is considered a risk factor for developing {AD}. Within this cross-sectional, multi-center study 228 cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects (118 males) completed an {MRI} at 1.5T, physiological and blood parameter assessments. The multivariate regression model combining all measured parameters was capable of explaining 39\% of {BrainAGE} variance in males (p {\textless} 0.001) and 32\% in females (p {\textless} 0.01). Furthermore, markers of the metabolic syndrome as well as markers of liver and kidney functions were profoundly related to {BrainAGE} scores in males (p {\textless} 0.05). In females, markers of liver and kidney functions as well as supply of vitamin B12 were significantly related to {BrainAGE} (p {\textless} 0.05). In conclusion, in cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects several clinical markers of poor health were associated with subtle structural changes in the brain that reflect accelerated aging, whereas protective effects on brain aging were observed for markers of good health. Additionally, the relations between individual brain aging and miscellaneous health markers show gender-specific patterns. The {BrainAGE} approach may thus serve as a clinically relevant biomarker for the detection of subtly abnormal patterns of brain aging probably preceding cognitive decline and development of {AD}.},

	abstract = {Both monolithic and semi-monolithic scintillator positron emission tomography ({PET}) detectors can measure the depth of interaction with single-ended readout. Usually scintillators with a thickness of 10 mm or less are used since the position resolutions of the detectors degrade as the scintillator thickness increases. In this work, the performance of a 20 mm thick long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator {PET} detector was measured by using both single-ended and dual-ended readouts with silicon photomultiplier ({SiPM}) arrays to provide a high detection efficiency. The semi-monolithic scintillator detector consists of nine lutetium–yttrium oxyorthosilicate slices measuring 1.37 × 51.2 × 20 mm3 with erythrocyte sedimentation rate foils of 0.065 mm thickness in between the slices. The {SiPM} array at each end of the scintillator detector consists of 16 × 4 {SiPMs} with a pixel size of 3.0 × 3.0 mm2 and a pitch of 3.2 mm. The 64 signals of each {SiPM} array are processed by using the {TOFPET}2 application-specific integrated circuit individually. All but the edge slices can be clearly resolved for the detectors with both single-ended and dual-ended readouts. The single-ended readout detector provides an average full width at half maximum ({FWHM}) Y (continuous direction) position resolution of 2.43 mm, Z (depth direction) position resolution of 4.77 mm, energy resolution of 25.7\% and timing resolution of 779 ps. The dual-ended readout detector significantly improves the Y and Z position resolutions, slightly improves the energy and timing resolution at the cost of two photodetectors required for one detector module and provides an average {FWHM} Y position resolution of 1.97 mm, Z position resolution of 2.60 mm, energy resolution of 21.7\% and timing resolution of 718 ps. The energy and timing resolution of the semi-monolithic scintillator detector in this work are worse than those of the segmented scintillator array detector and need to be further improved. The semi-monolithic scintillator detector described in this work reduces costs as compared to the traditional segmented scintillator array detector and reduces the edge effect as compared to the monolithic scintillator detector.},

Tract-tracing studies in the monkey reveal that these corticostriatal connections form stereotyped patterns in the striatum. Here the organization of the striatum was explored in the human with resting-state functional connectivity {MRI} ({fcMRI}). Data from 1,000 subjects were registered with nonlinear deformation of the striatum in combination with surface-based alignment of the cerebral cortex. {fcMRI} maps derived from seed regions placed in the foot and tongue representations of the motor cortex yielded the expected inverted somatotopy in the putamen. {fcMRI} maps derived from the supplementary motor area were located medially to the primary motor representation, also consistent with anatomical studies. The topography of the complete striatum was estimated and replicated by assigning each voxel in the striatum to its most strongly correlated cortical network in two independent groups of 500 subjects. The results revealed at least five cortical zones in the striatum linked to sensorimotor, premotor, limbic, and two association networks with a topography globally consistent with monkey anatomical studies. The majority of the human striatum was coupled to cortical association networks. Examining these association networks further revealed details that fractionated the five major networks. The resulting estimates of striatal organization provide a reference for exploring how the striatum contributes to processing motor, limbic, and heteromodal information through multiple large-scale corticostriatal circuits.},

In this study we explored the organization of cerebrocerebellar circuits in the human using resting-state functional connectivity {MRI} ({fcMRI}). Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using nonlinear deformation of the cerebellum in combination with surface-based alignment of the cerebral cortex. The foot, hand, and tongue representations were localized in subjects performing movements. {fcMRI} maps derived from seed regions placed in different parts of the motor body representation yielded the expected inverted map of somatomotor topography in the anterior lobe and the upright map in the posterior lobe. Next, we mapped the complete topography of the cerebellum by estimating the principal cerebral target for each point in the cerebellum in a discovery sample of 500 subjects and replicated the topography in 500 independent subjects. The majority of the human cerebellum maps to association areas. Quantitative analysis of 17 distinct cerebral networks revealed that the extent of the cerebellum dedicated to each network is proportional to the network's extent in the cerebrum with a few exceptions, including primary visual cortex, which is not represented in the cerebellum. Like somatomotor representations, cerebellar regions linked to association cortex have separate anterior and posterior representations that are oriented as mirror images of one another. The orderly topography of the representations suggests that the cerebellum possesses at least two large, homotopic maps of the full cerebrum and possibly a smaller third map.},

	abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity {MRI}. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex ({MT}+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the {MT}+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

Individual probabilistic tractography analyses were conducted in 100 subjects using the highest resolution data currently available. Tractography results were refined using a novel algorithm to objectively determine slice level thresholds that best minimized overlap between tracts while preserving tract volume. Consistent with tracing studies in monkey and rodent, our observations show that cortical topography is generally preserved through the internal capsule, with the {preSMA} tract remaining most anterior and the primary somatosensory tract remaining most posterior. We combine our results into a freely available white matter template named the {SMATT}. We also provide a probabilistic {SMATT} that quantifies the extent of overlap between tracts. Finally, we assess how the {SMATT} operates at the individual subject level in another independent data set, and in an individual after stroke. The {SMATT} and probabilistic {SMATT} provide new tools that segment and label sensorimotor tracts at a spatial resolution not previously available.},

{SETTING}: Geriatric rehabilitation unit.
{SUBJECTS}: Thirty-two consecutive patients with stroke {\textgreater} or = 65 years of age.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Two-channel current stimulator {TENS} {CEFAR} Tempo with four self-adhesive skin electrodes. The stimulator delivered a high-frequency constant current of 40 Hz. The strength of the stimulation was quantifiable and assessed in milliampere ({mA}).
{INTERVENTIONS}: The assessments were performed on the hands and feet by two raters. The {PTT} was identified as the level registered in milliampere ({mA}) at which the patients perceived a tingling sensation.
{RESULTS}: The {ICC} values (0.94-0.99) were shown to be good for inter-rater reliability, as well as reliability between occasions. However an additional analysis with limits of agreement showed a high level of agreement for assessment of the hand but a moderate to low agreement for assessment of the foot where some bias was also identified. Clinical acceptable reliability: {\textgreater} or = 1 {mA} for the hand and {\textgreater} or = 5 {mA} for the foot are so far recommended for establishing real differences in clinical measures.

            Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with substantial phenotypic, biological, and etiologic heterogeneity. It remains a challenge to identify biomarkers to stratify autism into replicable cognitive or biological subtypes. Here, we aim to introduce a novel methodological framework for parsing neuroanatomical subtypes within a large cohort of individuals with autism. We used cortical thickness ({CT}) in a large and well-characterized sample of 316 participants with autism (88 female, age mean: 17.2 ± 5.7) and 206 with neurotypical development (79 female, age mean: 17.5 ± 6.1) aged 6–31 years across six sites from the {EU}-{AIMS} multi-center Longitudinal European Autism Project. Five biologically based putative subtypes were derived using normative modeling of {CT} and spectral clustering. Three of these clusters showed relatively widespread decreased {CT} and two showed relatively increased {CT}. These subtypes showed morphometric differences from one another, providing a potential explanation for inconsistent case–control findings in autism, and loaded differentially and more strongly onto symptoms and polygenic risk, indicating a dilution of clinical effects across heterogeneous cohorts. Our results provide an important step towards parsing the heterogeneous neurobiology of autism.},

{SETTING}: The inpatient neurology and neurosurgery wards of a university hospital.
{DESIGN}: Through discussions between four experienced neurophysiotherapists, the testing procedures of the revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment were further standardized. Subsequently, the intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities of the {EmNSA} were investigated.
{RESULTS}: The intra-rater reliability of the tactile sensations, sharp blunt discrimination and the proprioception items of the {EmNSA} were generally good to excellent for both raters with a range of weighted kappa coefficients between 0.58 and 1.00. Likewise the inter-rater reliabilities of these items were predominantly good to excellent with a range of weighted kappa coefficients between 0.46 and 1.00. An exception was the two-point discrimination that had a poor to good reliability, with the range for intra-rater reliability of 0.11-0.63 and for inter-rater reliability -0.10-0.66.
{CONCLUSION}: The {EmNSA} is a reliable screening tool to evaluate primary somatosensory impairments in neurological and neurosurgical inpatients with intracranial disorders.

To date, this is generally thought to be most precise when done manually, which is, however, both time-consuming and potentially observer-dependent. Fully automated lesion demarcation methods have been developed to address these issues, but these are often not practicable in acute stroke research where for each patient only a single image modality is available and the available image modality differs over patients. In the current study, we evaluated a semi-automated lesion demarcation approach, the so-called Clusterize algorithm, in acute stroke patients scanned in a range of common image modalities. Our results suggest that, compared to the standard of manual lesion demarcation, the semi-automated Clusterize algorithm is capable of significantly speeding up lesion demarcation in the most commonly used image modalities, without loss of either lesion demarcation precision or lesion demarcation reproducibility. For the three investigated acute datasets ({CT}, {DWI}, T2FLAIR), containing a total of 44 patient images obtained in a regular clinical setting at patient admission, the reduction in processing time was on average 17.8 min per patient and this advantage increased with increasing lesion volume (up to 60 min per patient for the largest lesion volumes in our datasets). Additionally, our results suggest that performance of the Clusterize algorithm in a chronic dataset with 11 T1 images was comparable to its performance in the acute datasets. We thus advocate the use of the Clusterize algorithm, integrated into a simple, freely available {SPM} toolbox, for the precise, reliable and fast preparation of imaging data for lesion-behaviour mapping analyses.},

Sensorimotor evaluations and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were performed at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2) and after 4 weeks follow-up (T3). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was also performed in an age-matched healthy control group (n = 19) to identify patterns of aberrant connectivity in stroke patients between hemispheres, or within ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres. Mixed model analysis investigated session and treatment effects between stroke therapy groups. Non-parametric partial correlations were used to investigate brain-behaviour associations with age and frame-wise displacement as nuisance regressors. Connections within the contralesional hemisphere that showed hypo-connectivity in subacute stroke patients (compared with healthy controls) showed a trend towards a more pronounced pre-to-post normalization (less hypo-connectivity) in the motor therapy group, compared with the sensorimotor therapy group (mean estimated difference = -0.155 ± 0.061; P = 0.02). Further, the motor therapy group also tended to show a further pre-to-post increase in functional connectivity strength among connections that already showed hyper-connectivity in the stroke patients at baseline versus healthy controls (mean estimated difference = -0.144 ± 0.072; P = 0.06). Notably, these observed increases in hyper-connectivity of the contralesional hemisphere were positively associated with improvements in functional activity (r = 0.48), providing indications that these patterns of hyper-connectivity are compensatory in nature. The sensorimotor and motor therapy group showed no significant differences in terms of pre-to-post changes in inter-hemispheric connectivity or ipsilesional intrahemispheric connectivity. While effects are only tentative within this preliminary sample, results suggest a possible stronger normalization of hypo-connectivity and a stronger pre-to-post increase in compensatory hyper-connectivity of the contralesional hemisphere after motor therapy compared with sensorimotor therapy. Future studies with larger patient samples are however recommended to confirm these trend-based preliminary findings.},

	abstract = {Background: Somatosensory function plays an important role in motor learning. More than half of the stroke patients have somatosensory impairments in the upper limb, which could hamper recovery. Question: Is sensorimotor upper limb ({UL}) therapy of more benefit for motor and somatosensory outcome than motor therapy? Design: Randomized assessor- blinded multicenter controlled trial with block randomization stratified for neglect, severity of motor impairment, and type of stroke. Participants: 40 first-ever stroke patients with {UL} sensorimotor impairments admitted to the rehabilitation center. Intervention: Both groups received 16 h of additional therapy over 4 weeks consisting of sensorimotor (N = 22) or motor (N = 18) {UL} therapy. Outcome measures: Action Research Arm test ({ARAT}) as primary outcome, and other motor and somatosensory measures were assessed at baseline, post-intervention and after 4 weeks follow-up. Results: No significant between-group differences were found for change scores in {ARAT} or any somatosensory measure between the three time points. For {UL} impairment (Fugl-Meyer assessment), a significant greater improvement was found for the motor group compared to the sensorimotor group from baseline to post-intervention [mean ({SD}) improvement 14.65 (2.19) vs. 5.99 (2.06); p = 0.01] and from baseline to follow-up [17.38 (2.37) vs. 6.75 (2.29); p = 0.003]. Conclusion: {UL} motor therapy may improve motor impairment more than {UL} sensorimotor therapy in patients with sensorimotor impairments in the early rehabilitation phase post stroke. For these patients, integrated sensorimotor therapy may not improve somatosensory function and may be less effective for motor recovery.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Functional limitation of the upper extremities is common in patients with stroke. An upper-extremity measure with sound psychometric properties is indispensable for clinical and research use.
{OBJECTIVE}: The purpose of this study was to compare the psychometric properties of 4 clinical measures for assessing upper-extremity motor function in people with stroke: the upper-extremity subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Test ({UE}-{FM}), the upper-extremity subscale of the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement, the Action Research Arm Test ({ARAT}), and the Wolf Motor Function Test.
{DESIGN}: This was a prospective, longitudinal study.
{METHODS}: Fifty-three people with stroke were evaluated with the 4 measures at 4 time points (14, 30, 90, and 180 days after stroke). Thirty-five participants completed all of the assessments. The ceiling and floor effects, validity (concurrent validity and predictive validity), and responsiveness of each measure were examined. Interrater reliability and test-retest reliability also were examined.
{RESULTS}: All measures, except for the {UE}-{FM}, had significant floor effects or ceiling effects at one or more time points. The Spearman rho correlation coefficient for each pair of the 4 measures was {\textgreater} or =.81, indicating high concurrent validity. The predictive validity of the 4 measures was satisfactory (Spearman rho, {\textgreater} or =.51). The responsiveness of the 4 measures at 14 to 180 days after stroke was moderate (.52 {\textless} or = effect size {\textless} or = .79). The 4 measures had good interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [{ICC}], {\textgreater} or =.92) and test-retest reliability ({ICC}, {\textgreater} or =.97). Only the minimal detectable changes of the {UE}-{FM} (8\% of the highest possible score) and the {ARAT} (6\%) were satisfactory.
{LIMITATIONS}: The sample size was too small to conduct data analysis according to type or severity of stroke. In addition, the timed component of the Wolf Motor Function Test was not used in this study.
{CONCLUSIONS}: All 4 measures showed sufficient validity, responsiveness, and reliability in participants with stroke. The {UE}-{FM} for assessing impairment and the {ARAT} for assessing disability had satisfactory minimal detectable changes, supporting their utility in clinical settings.},

            Behavioural deficits in stroke reflect both structural damage at the site of injury, and widespread network dysfunction caused by structural, functional, and metabolic disconnection. Two recent methods allow for the estimation of structural and functional disconnection from clinical structural imaging. This is achieved by embedding a patient’s lesion into an atlas of functional and structural connections in healthy subjects, and deriving the ensemble of structural and functional connections that pass through the lesion, thus indirectly estimating its impact on the whole brain connectome. This indirect assessment of network dysfunction is more readily available than direct measures of functional and structural connectivity obtained with functional and diffusion {MRI}, respectively, and it is in theory applicable to a wide variety of disorders. To validate the clinical relevance of these methods, we quantified the prediction of behavioural deficits in a prospective cohort of 132 first-time stroke patients studied at 2 weeks post-injury (mean age 52.8 years, range 22–77; 63 females; 64 right hemispheres). Specifically, we used multivariate ridge regression to relate deficits in multiple functional domains (left and right visual, left and right motor, language, spatial attention, spatial and verbal memory) with the pattern of lesion and indirect structural or functional disconnection. In a subgroup of patients, we also measured direct alterations of functional connectivity with resting-state functional {MRI}. Both lesion and indirect structural disconnection maps were predictive of behavioural impairment in all domains (0.16 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.58) except for verbal memory (0.05 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.06). Prediction from indirect functional disconnection was scarce or negligible (0.01 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.18) except for the right visual field deficits (R2 = 0.38), even though multivariate maps were anatomically plausible in all domains. Prediction from direct measures of functional {MRI} functional connectivity in a subset of patients was clearly superior to indirect functional disconnection. In conclusion, the indirect estimation of structural connectivity damage successfully predicted behavioural deficits post-stroke to a level comparable to lesion information. However, indirect estimation of functional disconnection did not predict behavioural deficits, nor was a substitute for direct functional connectivity measurements, especially for cognitive disorders.},

            Inconsistent findings from migraine neuroimaging studies have limited attempts to localize migraine symptomatology. Novel brain network mapping techniques offer a new approach for linking neuroimaging findings to a common neuroanatomical substrate and localizing therapeutic targets. In this study, we attempted to determine whether neuroanatomically heterogeneous neuroimaging findings of migraine localize to a common brain network. We used meta-analytic coordinates of decreased grey matter volume in migraineurs as seed regions to generate resting state functional connectivity network maps from a normative connectome (n = 1000). Network maps were overlapped to identify common regions of connectivity across all coordinates. Specificity of our findings was evaluated using a whole-brain Bayesian spatial generalized linear mixed model and a region of interest analysis with comparison groups of chronic pain and a neurologic control (Alzheimer’s disease). We found that all migraine coordinates (11/11, 100\%) were negatively connected (t ≥ ±7, P \&lt; 10−6 family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons) to a single location in left extrastriate visual cortex overlying dorsal V3 and V3A subregions. More than 90\% of coordinates (10/11) were also positively connected with bilateral insula and negatively connected with the hypothalamus. Bayesian spatial generalized linear mixed model whole-brain analysis identified left V3/V3A as the area with the most specific connectivity to migraine coordinates compared to control coordinates (voxel-wise probability of ≥90\%). Post hoc region of interest analyses further supported the specificity of this finding ({ANOVA} P = 0.02; pairwise t-tests P = 0.03 and P = 0.003, respectively). In conclusion, using coordinate-based network mapping, we show that regions of grey matter volume loss in migraineurs localize to a common brain network defined by connectivity to visual cortex V3/V3A, a region previously implicated in mechanisms of cortical spreading depression in migraine. Our findings help unify migraine neuroimaging literature and offer a migraine-specific target for neuromodulatory treatment.},

Here, we study focal brain lesions that disrupt volition, causing akinetic mutism (
              n
              = 28), or disrupt agency, causing alien limb syndrome (
              n

We next used a recently validated technique termed lesion network mapping to determine whether these heterogeneous lesion locations localized to specific brain networks. Lesion locations causing akinetic mutism all fell within one network, defined by connectivity to the anterior cingulate cortex. Lesion locations causing alien limb fell within a separate network, defined by connectivity to the precuneus. Both findings were specific for these syndromes compared with brain lesions causing similar physical impairments but without disordered free will. Finally, our lesion-based localization matched network localization for brain stimulation locations that disrupt free will and neuroimaging abnormalities in patients with psychiatric disorders of free will without overt brain lesions. Collectively, our results demonstrate that lesions in different locations causing disordered volition and agency localize to unique brain networks, lending insight into the neuroanatomical substrate of free will perception.},

We found that visual memory and verbal memory were better predicted by {FC}, whereas visual and motor impairments were better predicted by lesion topography. Attention and language deficits were well predicted by both. Next, we identified a general pattern of physiological network dysfunction consisting of decrease of interhemispheric integration and intrahemispheric segregation, which strongly related to behavioral impairment in multiple domains.

            Behavioural deficits in stroke reflect both structural damage at the site of injury, and widespread network dysfunction caused by structural, functional, and metabolic disconnection. Two recent methods allow for the estimation of structural and functional disconnection from clinical structural imaging. This is achieved by embedding a patient’s lesion into an atlas of functional and structural connections in healthy subjects, and deriving the ensemble of structural and functional connections that pass through the lesion, thus indirectly estimating its impact on the whole brain connectome. This indirect assessment of network dysfunction is more readily available than direct measures of functional and structural connectivity obtained with functional and diffusion {MRI}, respectively, and it is in theory applicable to a wide variety of disorders. To validate the clinical relevance of these methods, we quantified the prediction of behavioural deficits in a prospective cohort of 132 first-time stroke patients studied at 2 weeks post-injury (mean age 52.8 years, range 22–77; 63 females; 64 right hemispheres). Specifically, we used multivariate ridge regression to relate deficits in multiple functional domains (left and right visual, left and right motor, language, spatial attention, spatial and verbal memory) with the pattern of lesion and indirect structural or functional disconnection. In a subgroup of patients, we also measured direct alterations of functional connectivity with resting-state functional {MRI}. Both lesion and indirect structural disconnection maps were predictive of behavioural impairment in all domains (0.16 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.58) except for verbal memory (0.05 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.06). Prediction from indirect functional disconnection was scarce or negligible (0.01 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.18) except for the right visual field deficits (R2 = 0.38), even though multivariate maps were anatomically plausible in all domains. Prediction from direct measures of functional {MRI} functional connectivity in a subset of patients was clearly superior to indirect functional disconnection. In conclusion, the indirect estimation of structural connectivity damage successfully predicted behavioural deficits post-stroke to a level comparable to lesion information. However, indirect estimation of functional disconnection did not predict behavioural deficits, nor was a substitute for direct functional connectivity measurements, especially for cognitive disorders.},

            Inconsistent findings from migraine neuroimaging studies have limited attempts to localize migraine symptomatology. Novel brain network mapping techniques offer a new approach for linking neuroimaging findings to a common neuroanatomical substrate and localizing therapeutic targets. In this study, we attempted to determine whether neuroanatomically heterogeneous neuroimaging findings of migraine localize to a common brain network. We used meta-analytic coordinates of decreased grey matter volume in migraineurs as seed regions to generate resting state functional connectivity network maps from a normative connectome (n = 1000). Network maps were overlapped to identify common regions of connectivity across all coordinates. Specificity of our findings was evaluated using a whole-brain Bayesian spatial generalized linear mixed model and a region of interest analysis with comparison groups of chronic pain and a neurologic control (Alzheimer’s disease). We found that all migraine coordinates (11/11, 100\%) were negatively connected (t ≥ ±7, P \&lt; 10−6 family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons) to a single location in left extrastriate visual cortex overlying dorsal V3 and V3A subregions. More than 90\% of coordinates (10/11) were also positively connected with bilateral insula and negatively connected with the hypothalamus. Bayesian spatial generalized linear mixed model whole-brain analysis identified left V3/V3A as the area with the most specific connectivity to migraine coordinates compared to control coordinates (voxel-wise probability of ≥90\%). Post hoc region of interest analyses further supported the specificity of this finding ({ANOVA} P = 0.02; pairwise t-tests P = 0.03 and P = 0.003, respectively). In conclusion, using coordinate-based network mapping, we show that regions of grey matter volume loss in migraineurs localize to a common brain network defined by connectivity to visual cortex V3/V3A, a region previously implicated in mechanisms of cortical spreading depression in migraine. Our findings help unify migraine neuroimaging literature and offer a migraine-specific target for neuromodulatory treatment.},

	abstract = {Our perception of free will is composed of a desire to act (volition) and a sense of responsibility for our actions (agency). Brain damage can disrupt these processes, but which regions are most important for free will perception remains unclear. Here, we study focal brain lesions that disrupt volition, causing akinetic mutism (
              n
              = 28), or disrupt agency, causing alien limb syndrome (
              n
              = 50), to better localize these processes in the human brain. Lesion locations causing either syndrome were highly heterogeneous, occurring in a variety of different brain locations. We next used a recently validated technique termed lesion network mapping to determine whether these heterogeneous lesion locations localized to specific brain networks. Lesion locations causing akinetic mutism all fell within one network, defined by connectivity to the anterior cingulate cortex. Lesion locations causing alien limb fell within a separate network, defined by connectivity to the precuneus. Both findings were specific for these syndromes compared with brain lesions causing similar physical impairments but without disordered free will. Finally, our lesion-based localization matched network localization for brain stimulation locations that disrupt free will and neuroimaging abnormalities in patients with psychiatric disorders of free will without overt brain lesions. Collectively, our results demonstrate that lesions in different locations causing disordered volition and agency localize to unique brain networks, lending insight into the neuroanatomical substrate of free will perception.},

We found that visual memory and verbal memory were better predicted by {FC}, whereas visual and motor impairments were better predicted by lesion topography. Attention and language deficits were well predicted by both. Next, we identified a general pattern of physiological network dysfunction consisting of decrease of interhemispheric integration and intrahemispheric segregation, which strongly related to behavioral impairment in multiple domains. Network-specific patterns of dysfunction predicted specific behavioral deficits, and loss of interhemispheric communication across a set of regions was associated with impairment across multiple behavioral domains.

	abstract = {Abstract
          The large heterogeneity in the symptomatology and severity of autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is a major drawback for the design of effective therapies. Beyond behavioral phenotypes, subtype stratification strategies that can be applied to large populations are needed, these combining different neurobiological characteristics and based on the large-scale organization of the human brain, as well as neurogenetic fingerprints. Here, we make use of {ABIDE}, the largest publicly available database of functional neuroimaging in {ASD}, to which we have applied rigorous data harmonization between the different scanning institutions in order to employ analyses based on consensus clustering and to evaluate the patterns of brain connectivity. As a result, we identified three subtypes of {ASD}, the first of which was characterized by a mixture of hyper- and hypo-connectivity, stronger network segregation and weaker integration, and it represented approximately 13\% of all patients. The second subtype was associated with 31\% of the patients, and it was characterized by hyperconnectivity but no topological differences with respect to the group of typically developing controls. The third was the most numerous subtype, assigned to 52\% of all patients, and it was characterized by hypoconnectivity, decreased network segregation and increased integration. We also defined a neurobiological signature for each of these subtypes, detailing the connectivity and structures most specific to each subtype. Strikingly, at the behavioral level, none of the neuropsychological scores used in the diagnosis of {ASD} is capable of differentiating any of the subtypes from the other two. Finally, we use the Allen Human Brain Atlas of gene transcription brain maps to show that subtype 2 has an extraordinary enrichment in biological processes related to the synthesis, regulation and transport of cholesterol and other lipoproteins, one of the mechanisms previously attributed to {ASD}. We also show that this lipid-susceptible {ASD} subtype could be represented by the dysfunctionality of the network, unlike the other two subtypes that have more structural alterations in the connectome. Thus, our study provide compelling support for prospects of cholesterol-related therapies in this subset of autistic individuals.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Despite significant research, the biological mechanisms underlying the brain degeneration in Myotonic Dystrophy Type I ({DM}1) remain largely unknown. Here we have assessed brain degeneration by measuring the volume loss ({VL}) and cognitive deficits ({CD}) in two cohorts of {DM}1 patients, and associating them to the large-scale brain transcriptome maps provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas ({AHBA}). From a list of preselected hypothesis-driven genes, three of them appear to play a major role in degeneration: dystrophin (
            {DMD})
            , alpha-synuclein (
            {SNCA})
            and the microtubule-associated protein tau (
            {MAPT})
            . Moreover, a purely data-driven strategy identified gene clusters enriched for key biological processes in the central nervous system, such as synaptic vesicle recycling, localization, endocytosis and exocytosis, and the serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter pathways. Therefore, by combining large-scale transcriptome interactions with brain imaging and cognitive function, we provide a new more comprehensive understanding of {DM}1 that might help define future therapeutic strategies and research into this condition.},

Despite recent advances in systems neuroscience, the biological basis underlying visuomotor functional impairments associated with these clinical conditions is poorly understood. In this study, we used neuroimaging connectomic approaches to map the visuomotor integration ({VMI}) system in the human brain and investigated the topology approximation of the {VMI} network to the Allen Human Brain Atlas, a whole-brain transcriptome-wide atlas of cortical genetic expression. We found the genetic expression of four genes—{TBR}1, {SCN}1A, {MAGEL}2, and {CACNB}4—to be prominently associated with visuomotor integrators in the human cortex. {TBR}1 gene transcripts, an {ASD} gene whose expression is related to neural development of the cortex and the hippocampus, showed a central spatial allocation within the {VMI} system. Our findings delineate gene expression traits underlying the {VMI} system in the human cortex, where specific genes, such as {TBR}1, are likely to play a central role in its neuronal organization, as well as on specific phenotypes of neurogenetic syndromes.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder ({MDD}) is common and disabling, but its neuropathophysiology remains unclear. Most studies of functional brain networks in {MDD} have had limited statistical power and data analysis approaches have varied widely. The {REST}-meta-{MDD} Project of resting-state {fMRI} (R-{fMRI}) addresses these issues. Twenty-five research groups in China established the {REST}-meta-{MDD} Consortium by contributing R-{fMRI} data from 1,300 patients with {MDD} and 1,128 normal controls ({NCs}). Data were preprocessed locally with a standardized protocol before aggregated group analyses. We focused on functional connectivity ({FC}) within the default mode network ({DMN}), frequently reported to be increased in {MDD}. Instead, we found decreased {DMN} {FC} when we compared 848 patients with {MDD} to 794 {NCs} from 17 sites after data exclusion. We found {FC} reduction only in recurrent {MDD}, not in first-episode drug-naïve {MDD}. Decreased {DMN} {FC} was associated with medication usage but not with {MDD} duration. {DMN} {FC} was also positively related to symptom severity but only in recurrent {MDD}. Exploratory analyses also revealed alterations in {FC} of visual, sensory-motor, and dorsal attention networks in {MDD}. We confirmed the key role of {DMN} in {MDD} but found reduced rather than increased {FC} within the {DMN}. Future studies should test whether decreased {DMN} {FC} mediates response to treatment. All R-{fMRI} indices of data contributed by the {REST}-meta-{MDD} consortium are being shared publicly via the R-{fMRI} Maps Project.},

Different from the previous implementations of consensus clustering, we thus propose to use the consensus strategy to combine the information arising from the connectivity patterns of each node. The proposed approach may be seen either as an exploratory technique or as an unsupervised pretraining step to help the subsequent construction of a supervised classifier. Applications on a toy model and two real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which represents heterogeneity of a set of subjects in terms of a weighted network, the consensus matrix.},

Further studies of depression-specific psychotherapies, the continued application of antidepressants, the development of new treatment compounds, and the status of new somatic treatments are also discussed. We address two treatment-related issues: suicide risk with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and the safety of antidepressants in pregnancy.

Following previous computational studies of familiarity memory, we investigate the dynamical properties of familiarity discrimination and contrast two different familiarity discriminators: one based on the energy of the neural network and the other based on the time derivative of the energy. We show how the familiarity signal decays rapidly after stimulus presentation. For both discriminators, we calculate the capacity using mean field analysis. Compared to recall capacity (the classical associative memory in Hopfield nets), both the energy and the slope discriminators have bigger capacity, yet the energy-based discriminator has a higher capacity than one based on its time derivative. Finally, both discriminators are found to have a different noise dependence.},

The functional consequences of adaptation are unclear. Typically a reduction of firing rate would reduce single neuron accuracy as less spikes are available for decoding, but it has been suggested that on the population level, adaptation increases coding accuracy. This question requires careful analysis as adaptation not only changes the firing rates of neurons, but also the neural variability and correlations between neurons, which affect coding accuracy as well. We calculate the coding accuracy using a computational model that implements two forms of adaptation: spike frequency adaptation and synaptic adaptation in the form of short-term synaptic plasticity. We find that the net effect of adaptation is subtle and heterogeneous. Depending on adaptation mechanism and test stimulus, adaptation can either increase or decrease coding accuracy. We discuss the neurophysiological and psychophysical implications of the findings and relate it to published experimental data.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0027224},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Experimental observations and numerical studies with dissipative metabolic networks have shown that cellular enzymatic activity self-organizes spontaneously leading to the emergence of a metabolic core formed by a set of enzymatic reactions which are always active under all environmental conditions, while the rest of catalytic processes are only intermittently active. The reactions of the metabolic core are essential for biomass formation and to assure optimal metabolic performance. The on-off catalytic reactions and the metabolic core are essential elements of a Systemic Metabolic Structure which seems to be a key feature common to all cellular organisms.
{METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: In order to investigate the functional importance of the metabolic core we have studied different catalytic patterns of a dissipative metabolic network under different external conditions. The emerging biochemical data have been analysed using information-based dynamic tools, such as Pearson's correlation and Transfer Entropy (which measures effective functionality). Our results show that a functional structure of effective connectivity emerges which is dynamical and characterized by significant variations of bio-molecular information flows.
{CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: We have quantified essential aspects of the metabolic core functionality. The always active enzymatic reactions form a hub--with a high degree of effective connectivity--exhibiting a wide range of functional information values being able to act either as a source or as a sink of bio-molecular causal interactions. Likewise, we have found that the metabolic core is an essential part of an emergent functional structure characterized by catalytic modules and metabolic switches which allow critical transitions in enzymatic activity. Both, the metabolic core and the catalytic switches in which also intermittently-active enzymes are involved seem to be fundamental elements in the self-regulation of the Systemic Metabolic Structure.},

The data were obtained by means of a yeast glycolytic model formed by three delay differential equations where the enzymatic rate equations of the irreversible stages have been explicitly considered. These enzymatic activity functions were previously modeled and tested experimentally by other different groups. The results show the emergence of a new kind of dynamical functional structure, characterized by changing connectivity flows and a metabolic invariant that constrains the activity of the irreversible enzymes. In addition to the classical topological structure characterized by the specific location of enzymes, substrates, products and feedback-regulatory metabolites, an effective functional structure emerges in the modeled glycolytic system, which is dynamical and characterized by notable variations of the functional interactions. The dynamical structure also exhibits a metabolic invariant which constrains the functional attributes of the enzymes. Finally, in accordance with the classical biochemical studies, our numerical analysis reveals in a quantitative manner that the enzyme phosphofructokinase is the key-core of the metabolic system, behaving for all conditions as the main source of the effective causal flows in yeast glycolysis.},

	abstract = {Cortical neurons are bistable; as a consequence their local field potentials can fluctuate between quiescent and active states, generating slow 0.5 2 Hz oscillations which are widely known as transitions between Up and Down States. Despite a large number of studies on Up-Down transitions, deciphering its nature, mechanisms and function are still today challenging tasks. In this paper we focus on recent experimental evidence, showing that a class of spontaneous oscillations can emerge within the Up states. In particular, a non-trivial peak around 20 Hz appears in their associated power-spectra, what produces an enhancement of the activity power for higher frequencies (in the 30-90 Hz band). Moreover, this rhythm within Ups seems to be an emergent or collective phenomenon given that individual neurons do not lock to it as they remain mostly unsynchronized. Remarkably, similar oscillations (and the concomitant peak in the spectrum) do not appear in the Down states. Here we shed light on these findings by using different computational models for the dynamics of cortical networks in presence of different levels of physiological complexity. Our conclusion, supported by both theory and simulations, is that the collective phenomenon of "stochastic amplification of fluctuations"--previously described in other contexts such as Ecology and Epidemiology--explains in an elegant and parsimonious manner, beyond model-dependent details, this extra-rhythm emerging only in the Up states but not in the Downs.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0058284},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The experimental observations and numerical studies with dissipative metabolic networks have shown that cellular enzymatic activity self-organizes spontaneously leading to the emergence of a Systemic Metabolic Structure in the cell, characterized by a set of different enzymatic reactions always locked into active states (metabolic core) while the rest of the catalytic processes are only intermittently active. This global metabolic structure was verified for Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it seems to be a common key feature to all cellular organisms. In concordance with these observations, the cell can be considered a complex metabolic network which mainly integrates a large ensemble of self-organized multienzymatic complexes interconnected by substrate fluxes and regulatory signals, where multiple autonomous oscillatory and quasi-stationary catalytic patterns simultaneously emerge. The network adjusts the internal metabolic activities to the external change by means of flux plasticity and structural plasticity.
{METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: In order to research the systemic mechanisms involved in the regulation of the cellular enzymatic activity we have studied different catalytic activities of a dissipative metabolic network under different external stimuli. The emergent biochemical data have been analysed using statistical mechanic tools, studying some macroscopic properties such as the global information and the energy of the system. We have also obtained an equivalent Hopfield network using a Boltzmann machine. Our main result shows that the dissipative metabolic network can behave as an attractor metabolic network.
{CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: We have found that the systemic enzymatic activities are governed by attractors with capacity to store functional metabolic patterns which can be correctly recovered from specific input stimuli. The network attractors regulate the catalytic patterns, modify the efficiency in the connection between the multienzymatic complexes, and stably retain these modifications. Here for the first time, we have introduced the general concept of attractor metabolic network, in which this dynamic behavior is observed.},

The Tsodyks and Markram ({TM}) model for short-term synaptic plasticity accurately accounts for a wide range of physiological responses at different types of cortical synapses. Here, we report a route to chaotic behavior via a Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation that dynamically organizes some of the responses in the {TM} model. In particular, the presence of such a homoclinic bifurcation strongly affects the shape of the trajectories in the phase space and induces highly irregular transient dynamics; indeed, in the vicinity of the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation, the number of population spikes and their precise timing are unpredictable and highly sensitive to the initial conditions. Such an irregular deterministic dynamics has its counterpart in stochastic/network versions of the {TM} model: The existence of the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation generates complex and irregular spiking patterns and--acting as a sort of springboard--facilitates transitions between the down-state and unstable periodic orbits. The interplay between the (deterministic) homoclinic bifurcation and stochastic effects may give rise to some of the complex dynamics observed in neural systems.},

Two approaches are used to estimate the {FC}: the Partial Correlation ({PC}) and the Transfer Entropy ({TE}). Both the {PC} and the {TE} show significant statistical differences between the group of patients and control subjects; in brief, the inter-hemispheric {PC} and the intra-hemispheric {TE} account for such differences.

Our results extend the recent analysis of dynamical oscillators models on the connectome structure, taking into account lagged and directional influences, focusing only on the nodes that are more prone to became bottlenecks of information. The ratio between the outgoing and the incoming information at each node is related to the the sum of the weights to that node and to the average time between consecutive time flips of spins. The results for the connectome of 66 nodes and for that of 998 nodes are similar, thus suggesting that these properties are scale-independent.

	abstract = {Biochemical energy is the fundamental element that maintains both the adequate turnover of the biomolecular structures and the functional metabolic viability of unicellular organisms. The levels of {ATP}, {ADP} and {AMP} reflect roughly the energetic status of the cell, and a precise ratio relating them was proposed by Atkinson as the adenylate energy charge ({AEC}). Under growth-phase conditions, cells maintain the {AEC} within narrow physiological values, despite extremely large fluctuations in the adenine nucleotides concentration. Intensive experimental studies have shown that these {AEC} values are preserved in a wide variety of organisms, both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Here, to understand some of the functional elements involved in the cellular energy status, we present a computational model conformed by some key essential parts of the adenylate energy system. Specifically, we have considered (I) the main synthesis process of {ATP} from {ADP}, ({II}) the main catalyzed phosphotransfer reaction for interconversion of {ATP}, {ADP} and {AMP}, ({III}) the enzymatic hydrolysis of {ATP} yielding {ADP}, and ({IV}) the enzymatic hydrolysis of {ATP} providing {AMP}. This leads to a dynamic metabolic model (with the form of a delayed differential system) in which the enzymatic rate equations and all the physiological kinetic parameters have been explicitly considered and experimentally tested in vitro. Our central hypothesis is that cells are characterized by changing energy dynamics (homeorhesis). The results show that the {AEC} presents stable transitions between steady states and periodic oscillations and, in agreement with experimental data these oscillations range within the narrow {AEC} window. Furthermore, the model shows sustained oscillations in the Gibbs free energy and in the total nucleotide pool. The present study provides a step forward towards the understanding of the fundamental principles and quantitative laws governing the adenylate energy system, which is a fundamental element for unveiling the dynamics of cellular life.},

The topic is being addressed primarily at the molecular level, and results are promising. However, translation to practical medicine is still pending. Our intention in this study is to approach the problem in a series of clear cell renal cell carcinomas with the tools that pathologists use in routine practice. Three randomly selected areas of 48 clear cell renal cell carcinomas prospectively collected in two different institutions were analysed for intratumour heterogeneity. The evaluated parameters were tumour size, cell type (clear vs. eosinophilic), Fuhrman's grade and immunohistochemical expression of carbonic anhydrase {IX}, {BRCA}1-associated protein-1 ({BAP}-1), cyclooxygenase-2 ({COX}-2) and Ki67. Intratumour heterogeneity was detected in 26 cases (54 \%). Cell type, grade and Ki67 index were the parameters more frequently heterogeneous amounting, respectively, 44, 42 and 38 \%. Tumour size was a significantly discriminative factor to predict tumour heterogeneity, with a cut-off of 3.8 cm (p {\textless} 0.001). Aside from tumour size, the most relevant parameters related with intratumour heterogeneity were cell type (clear vs. eosinophilic), Fuhrman's grade and Ki67 and {COX}-2 expression patterns. Carbonic anhydrase 9 and {BAP}-1 did not show statistical relevance. We conclude that heterogeneity is a common event in clear cell renal cell carcinomas that may be overlooked in cases insufficiently sampled. Tumour size appears as a reliable tool in identifying this situation since clear cell renal cell carcinomas under 3.8 cm in diameter are always homogeneous. This point may help the pathologist to make decisions in tumour sampling.},

Indeed, different {MRI} acquisitions provide different brain networks at the macroscale; whilst diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({dMRI}) provides a structural connectivity ({SC}) coincident with the bundles of parallel fibers between brain areas, functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) accounts for the variations in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent T2(*) signal, providing functional connectivity ({FC}). Understanding the precise relation between {FC} and {SC}, that is, between brain dynamics and structure, is still a challenge for neuroscience. To investigate this problem, we acquired data at rest and built the corresponding {SC} (with matrix elements corresponding to the fiber number between brain areas) to be compared with {FC} connectivity matrices obtained by three different methods: directed dependencies by an exploratory version of structural equation modeling ({eSEM}), linear correlations (C) and partial correlations ({PC}). We also considered the possibility of using lagged correlations in time series; in particular, we compared a lagged version of {eSEM} and Granger causality ({GC}). Our results were two-fold: firstly, {eSEM} performance in correlating with {SC} was comparable to those obtained from C and {PC}, but {eSEM} (not C, nor {PC}) provides information about directionality of the functional interactions. Second, interactions on a time scale much smaller than the sampling time, captured by instantaneous connectivity methods, are much more related to {SC} than slow directed influences captured by the lagged analysis. Indeed the performance in correlating with {SC} was much worse for {GC} and for the lagged version of {eSEM}.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Neural systems are comprised of interacting units, and relevant information regarding their function or malfunction can be inferred by analyzing the statistical dependencies between the activity of each unit. While correlations and mutual information are commonly used to characterize these dependencies, our objective here is to extend interactions to triplets of variables to better detect and characterize dynamic information transfer.
{APPROACH}: Our approach relies on the measure of interaction information ({II}). The sign of {II} provides information as to the extent to which the interaction of variables in triplets is redundant (R) or synergetic (S). Three variables are said to be redundant when a third variable, say Z, added to a pair of variables (X, Y), diminishes the information shared between X and Y. Similarly, the interaction in the triplet is said to be synergetic when conditioning on Z enhances the information shared between X and Y with respect to the unconditioned state. Here, based on this approach, we calculated the R and S status for triplets of electrophysiological data recorded from drug-resistant patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in order to study the spatial organization and dynamics of R and S close to the epileptogenic zone (the area responsible for seizure propagation).
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: In terms of spatial organization, our results show that R matched the epileptogenic zone while S was distributed more in the surrounding area. In relation to dynamics, R made the largest contribution to high frequency bands (14-100 Hz), while S was expressed more strongly at lower frequencies (1-7 Hz). Thus, applying {II} to such clinical data reveals new aspects of epileptogenic structure in terms of the nature (redundancy versus synergy) and dynamics (fast versus slow rhythms) of the interactions.
{SIGNIFICANCE}: We expect this methodology, robust and simple, can reveal new aspects beyond pair-interactions in networks of interacting units in other setups with multi-recording data sets (and thus, not necessarily in epilepsy, the pathology we have approached here).},

Here, to shed some light on this problem and, under the hypothesis that {CSD} might mediate aura migraine, we aim to study different aspects favoring or disfavoring the propagation of {CSD}. In particular, by using a computational neuronal model distributed throughout a realistic cortical mesh, we study the role that the geometry has in shaping {CSD}. Our results are two-fold: first, we found significant differences in the propagation traveling patterns of {CSD}, both intra and inter-hemispherically, revealing important asymmetries in the propagation profile. Second, we developed methods able to identify brain regions featuring a peculiar behavior during {CSD} propagation. Our study reveals dynamical aspects of {CSD}, which, if applied to subject-specific cortical geometry, might shed some light on how to differentiate between healthy subjects and those suffering migraine.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Intratumor heterogeneity may be responsible of the unpredictable aggressive clinical behavior that some clear cell renal cell carcinomas display. This clinical uncertainty may be caused by insufficient sampling, leaving out of histological analysis foci of high grade tumor areas. Although molecular approaches are providing important information on renal intratumor heterogeneity, a focus on this topic from the practicing pathologist' perspective is still pending.
{METHODS}: Four distant tumor areas of 40 organ-confined clear cell renal cell carcinomas were selected for histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation. Tumor size, cell type (clear/granular), Fuhrman's grade, Staging, as well as immunostaining with Snail, {ZEB}1, Twist, Vimentin, E-cadherin, β-catenin, {PTEN}, p-Akt, p110α, and {SETD}2, were analyzed for intratumor heterogeneity using a classification and regression tree algorithm.
{RESULTS}: Cell type and Fuhrman's grade were heterogeneous in 12.5 and 60 \% of the tumors, respectively. If cell type was homogeneous (clear cell) then the tumors were low-grade in 88.57 \% of cases. Immunostaining heterogeneity was significant in the series and oscillated between 15 \% for p110α and 80 \% for Snail. When Snail immunostaining was homogeneous the tumor was histologically homogeneous in 100 \% of cases. If Snail was heterogeneous, the tumor was heterogeneous in 75 \% of the cases. Average tumor diameter was 4.3 cm. Tumors larger than 3.7 cm were heterogeneous for Vimentin immunostaining in 72.5 \% of cases. Tumors displaying negative immunostaining for both {ZEB}1 and Twist were low grade in 100 \% of the cases.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Intratumor heterogeneity is a common event in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, which can be monitored by immunohistochemistry in routine practice. Snail seems to be particularly useful in the identification of intratumor heterogeneity. The suitability of current sampling protocols in renal cancer is discussed.},

Fibroblast activation protein expression has been correlated with prognosis in several malignancies but never in renal cancer. We aim to analyze the immunohistochemical expression of fibroblast activation protein in 208 clear cell renal cell carcinomas and to evaluate its impact on the prognosis and survival. A positive cytoplasmic immunostaining of this protein in the stromal fibroblasts associated to cancer cells is associated with large tumor diameter (≥4cm), high-grade (G3/4) tumors, and high-stage (≥{pT}3) tumors. Fibroblast activation protein-positive cases had significantly shorter survivals after 5 (P=.00015), 10 (P=.0000042), and 15 (P=.000043) years of follow-up, with a hazard ratio of 0.31. Multivariate analysis showed that fibroblast activation protein (P=.00117) was stronger than grade and stage in predicting clinical aggressiveness in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. This study confirms the usefulness of fibroblast activation protein detection in the stromal fibroblast associated to cancer in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and adds a new immunohistochemical marker to predict clinical behavior in these patients.},

	abstract = {Intratumor heterogeneity ({ITH}) is an inherent process in cancer development which follows for most of the cases a branched pattern of evolution, with different cell clones evolving independently in space and time across different areas of the same tumor. The determination of {ITH} (in both spatial and temporal domains) is nowadays critical to enhance patient treatment and prognosis. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ({CCRCC}) provides a good example of {ITH}. Sometimes the tumor is too big to be totally analyzed for {ITH} detection and pathologists decide which parts must be sampled for the analysis. For such a purpose, pathologists follow internationally accepted protocols. In light of the latest findings, however, current sampling protocols seem to be insufficient for detecting {ITH} with significant reliability. The arrival of new targeted therapies, some of them providing promising alternatives to improve patient survival, pushes the pathologist to obtain a truly representative sampling of tumor diversity in routine practice. How large this sampling must be and how this must be performed are unanswered questions so far.  Here we present a very simple method for tumor sampling that enhances {ITH} detection without increasing costs. This method follows a divide-and-conquer ({DAC}) strategy, that is, rather than sampling a small number of large-size tumor-pieces as the routine protocol ({RP}) advises, we suggest sampling many small-size pieces along the tumor. We performed a computational modeling approach to show that the usefulness of the {DAC} strategy is twofold: first, we show that {DAC} outperforms {RP} with similar laboratory costs, and second, {DAC} is capable of performing similar to total tumor sampling ({TTS}) but, very remarkably, at a much lower cost. We thus provide new light to push forward a shift in the paradigm about how pathologists should sample tumors for achieving efficient {ITH} detection.},

This paper is a continuation of this work, but here we focus on {DAC} implementation in the Pathology Laboratory. In particular, we describe a new simple method that makes use of a cutting grid device and is applied to clear cell renal cell carcinomas for {DAC} implementation. This method assures a thorough sampling of large surgical specimens, facilitates the demonstration of intratumor heterogeneity, and saves time to pathologists in the daily practice. The method involves the following steps: 1. Thin slicing of the tumor (by hand or machine), 2. Application of a cutting grid to the slices ( e.g., a French fry cutter), resulting in multiple tissue cubes with fixed position within the slice, 3. Selection of tissue cubes for analysis, and finally, 4. Inclusion of selected cubes into a cassette for histological processing (with about eight tissue fragments within each cassette). Thus, using our approach in a 10 cm in-diameter-tumor we generate 80 tumor tissue fragments placed in 10 cassettes and, notably, in a tenth of time. Eighty samples obtained across all the regions of the tumor will assure a much higher performance in detecting intratumor heterogeneity, as proved recently with synthetic data.},

            Heart rate variability ({HRV}) abnormalities are potential early biomarkers in Parkinson’s disease ({PD}) but their relationship with central autonomic network ({CAN}) activity is not fully understood. We analyzed the synchronization between {HRV} and brain activity in 31 {PD} patients and 21 age-matched healthy controls using blood-oxygen-level-dependent ({BOLD}) signals from resting-state functional brain {MRI} and {HRV} metrics from finger plethysmography recorded for 7.40 min. We additionally quantified autonomic symptoms ({SCOPA}-{AUT}) and objective autonomic cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure and heart rate) during deep breathing, Valsalva, and head-up tilt, which were used to classify the clinical severity of dysautonomia. We evaluated {HRV} and {BOLD} signals synchronization ({HRV}-{BOLD}-sync) with Pearson lagged cross-correlations and Fisher’s statistics for combining window-length-dependent {HRV}-{BOLD}-Sync Maps and assessed their association with clinical dysautonomia. {HRV}-{BOLD}-sync was lower significantly in {PD} than in controls in various brain regions within {CAN} or in networks involved in autonomic modulation. Moreover, heart-brain synchronization index ({HBSI}), which quantifies heart-brain synchronization at a single-subject level, showed an inverse exposure–response relationship with dysautonomia severity, finding the lowest {HBSI} in patients with severe dysautonomia, followed by moderate, mild, and, lastly, controls. Importantly, {HBSI} was associated in {PD}, but not in controls, with Valsalva pressure recovery time (sympathetic), deep breathing E/I ratio (cardiovagal), and {SCOPA}-{AUT}. Our findings support the existence of heart-brain de-synchronization in {PD} with an impact on clinically relevant autonomic outcomes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Epilepsy, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures resulting from a wide variety of causes, is one of the world’s most prominent neurological disabilities. Seizures, which are an expression of neuronal network dysfunction, occur in a positive feedback loop of concomitant factors, including neuro-inflammatory responses, where seizures generate more seizures. Among other pathways involved in inflammatory responses, the {JAK}/{STAT} signalling pathway has been proposed to participate in epilepsy.
            Here, we tested an in vitro model of temporal lobe epilepsy, with the hypothesis that acute blockage of {STAT}3-phosphorylation during epileptogenesis would prevent structural damage in the hippocampal circuitry and the imprinting of both neural epileptic activity and inflammatory glial states. We performed calcium imaging of spontaneous circuit dynamics in organotypic hippocampal slices previously exposed to epileptogenic conditions through the blockage of {GABAergic} synaptic transmission.
            Epileptogenic conditions lead to epileptic dynamics imprinted on circuits in terms of increased neuronal firing and circuit synchronization, increased correlated activity in neuronal pairs and decreased complexity in synchronization patterns. Acute blockage of the {STAT}3-phosphorylation during epileptogenesis prevented the imprinting of epileptic activity patterns, general cell loss, loss of {GABAergic} neurons and the persistence of reactive glial states. This work provides mechanistic evidence that blocking the {STAT}3 signalling pathway during epileptogenesis can prevent patho-topological persistent reorganization of neuro-glial circuits.},

While these relationships have been studied intensely for positively correlated networks, considerably less attention has been paid to negatively correlated networks, a. k.a. anticorrelated networks ({ACNs}). Although the most celebrated of all {ACNs} is the default mode network ({DMN}), and has even been extensively studied in health and disease, for systematically all {ACNs} other than {DMN}, there is no comprehensive study yet. Here, we have addressed this issue by making use of three neuroimaging data sets: one of N = 192 healthy young adults to fully describe {ACN}, another of N = 40 subjects to compare {ACN} between two groups of young and old participants, and another of N = 1,000 subjects from the Human Connectome Project to evaluate the association between {ACN} and cognitive scores. We first provide a comprehensive description of the anatomical composition of all {ACNs}, each of which participated in distinct resting-state networks ({RSNs}). In terms of participation ranking, from highest to the lowest, the major anticorrelated brain areas are the precuneus, the anterior supramarginal gyrus and the central opercular cortex. Next, by evaluating a more detailed structure of {ACN}, we show it is possible to find significant differences in {ACN} between specific conditions, in particular, by comparing groups of young and old participants. Our main finding is that of increased anticorrelation for cerebellar interactions in older subjects. Finally, in the voxel-level association study with cognitive scores, we show that {ACN} has multiple clusters of significance, clusters that are different from those obtained from positive correlated networks, indicating a functional cognitive meaning of {ACN}. Overall, our results give special relevance to {ACN} and suggest their use to disentangle unknown alterations in certain conditions, as could occur in early-onset neurodegenerative diseases or in some psychiatric conditions.},

An {AI} algorithm was used to improve the early diagnosis of melanoma and to predict the risk of metastasis and of disease-free survival. Two models were obtained to predict metastasis (including “all patients” or only patients “at early stages of melanoma”), and a series of attributes were seen to predict the progression of metastasis: Breslow thickness, infiltrating {BCL}-2 expressing lymphocytes, and {IL}-4 and {IL}-6 serum levels. Importantly, a decrease in serum {GM}-{CSF} seems to be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with early-stage melanomas.},

            Clinical evidence based on real‐world data ({RWD}) is accumulating exponentially providing larger sample sizes available, which demand novel methods to deal with the enhanced heterogeneity of the data. Here, we used {RWD} to assess the prediction of cognitive decline in a large heterogeneous sample of participants being enrolled with cognitive stimulation, a phenomenon that is of great interest to clinicians but that is riddled with difficulties and limitations. More precisely, from a multitude of neuropsychological Training Materials ({TMs}), we asked whether was possible to accurately predict an individual's cognitive decline one year after being tested. In particular, we performed longitudinal modelling of the scores obtained from 215 different tests, grouped into 29 cognitive domains, a total of 124,610 instances from 7902 participants (40\% male, 46\% female, 14\% not indicated), each performing an average of 16 tests. Employing a machine learning approach based on {ROC} analysis and cross‐validation techniques to overcome overfitting, we show that different {TMs} belonging to several cognitive domains can accurately predict cognitive decline, while other domains perform poorly, suggesting that the ability to predict decline one year later is not specific to any particular domain, but is rather widely distributed across domains. Moreover, when addressing the same problem between individuals with a common diagnosed label, we found that some domains had more accurate classification for conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Down syndrome, whereas they are less accurate for Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis. Future research should combine similar approaches to ours with standard neuropsychological measurements to enhance interpretability and the possibility of generalizing across different cohorts.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous mapping of multiple behavioral domains into brain networks remains a major challenge. Here, we shed some light on this problem by employing a combination of machine learning, structural and functional brain networks at different spatial resolutions (also known as scales), together with performance scores across multiple neurobehavioral domains, including sensation, motor skills, and cognition. Provided by the Human Connectome Project, we make use of three cohorts: 640 participants for model training, 160 subjects for validation, and 200 subjects for model performance testing thus enhancing prediction generalization. Our modeling consists of two main stages, namely dimensionality reduction in brain network features at multiple scales, followed by canonical correlation analysis, which determines an optimal linear combination of connectivity features to predict multiple behavioral performance scores. To assess the differences in the predictive power of each modality, we separately applied three different strategies: structural unimodal, functional unimodal, and multimodal, that is, structural in combination with functional features of the brain network. Our results show that the multimodal association outperforms any of the unimodal analyses. Then, to answer which human brain structures were most involved in predicting multiple behavioral scores, we simulated different synthetic scenarios in which in each case we completely deleted a brain structure or a complete resting state network, and recalculated performance in its absence. In deletions, we found critical structures to affect performance when predicting single behavioral domains, but this occurred in a lesser manner for prediction of multi-domain behavior. Overall, our results confirm that although there are synergistic contributions between brain structure and function that enhance behavioral prediction, brain networks may also be mutually redundant in predicting multidomain behavior, such that even after deletion of a structure, the connectivity of the others can compensate for its lack in predicting behavior.},

            Beyond the characteristics of a brain lesion, such as its etiology, size or location, lesion network mapping ({LNM}) has shown that similar symptoms after a lesion reflects similar dis-connectivity patterns, thereby linking symptoms to brain networks. Here, we extend {LNM} by using a multimodal strategy, combining functional and structural networks from 1000 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. We apply multimodal {LNM} to a cohort of 54 stroke patients with the aim of predicting sensorimotor behavior, as assessed through a combination of motor and sensory tests. Results are two-fold. First, multimodal {LNM} reveals that the functional modality contributes more than the structural one in the prediction of sensorimotor behavior. Second, when looking at each modality individually, the performance of the structural networks strongly depended on whether sensorimotor performance was corrected for lesion size, thereby eliminating the effect that larger lesions generally produce more severe sensorimotor impairment. In contrast, functional networks provided similar performance regardless of whether or not the effect of lesion size was removed. Overall, these results support the extension of {LNM} to its multimodal form, highlighting the synergistic and additive nature of different types of network modalities, and their corresponding influence on behavioral performance after brain injury.},

            Neurotransmitter exocytosis and short-term synaptic plasticity ({STSP}) regulate large-scale brain electrical activity. This study is the first, to our knowledge, proposing a multiple-time-scale model that bridges between the microscopic and mesoscopic scales. It is parsimonious, yet with enough descriptive power to express, on the one hand, the interactions between the {SNARE} and Sec1/Munc18 ({SM}) protein complexes mediating all forms of neurotransmitter release and {STSP} and, on the other hand, the electrical activity required for neuronal communication. A key finding is the discovery of a mathematical structure, termed activity-induced transcritical canard, which quantifies and explains delayed and irregular exocytosis. This structure also provides a previously unidentified way to understand delayed and irregular processes sensitive to initial conditions across various biology processes.
          , 
            Communication between neurons at chemical synapses is regulated by hundreds of different proteins that control the release of neurotransmitter that is packaged in vesicles, transported to an active zone, and released when an input spike occurs. Neurotransmitter can also be released asynchronously, that is, after a delay following the spike, or spontaneously in the absence of a stimulus. The mechanisms underlying asynchronous and spontaneous neurotransmitter release remain elusive. Here, we describe a model of the exocytotic cycle of vesicles at excitatory and inhibitory synapses that accounts for all modes of vesicle release as well as short-term synaptic plasticity ({STSP}). For asynchronous release, the model predicts a delayed inertial protein unbinding associated with the {SNARE} complex assembly immediately after vesicle priming. Experiments are proposed to test the model’s molecular predictions for differential exocytosis. The simplicity of the model will also facilitate large-scale simulations of neural circuits.},

              {INTRODUCTION}
              {BrainAge} models based on neuroimaging data have diagnostic classification power but have replicability issues due to site and patient variability. {BrainAge} models trained on neuropsychological tests could help distinguish stable mild cognitive impairment ({sMCI}) from progressive {MCI} ({pMCI}) to Alzheimer's disease ({AD}).
            
            
              {METHODS}
              A linear regressor {BrainAge} model was trained on healthy controls using neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging features separately. The {BrainAge} delta, predicted age minus chronological age, was used to distinguish between {sMCI} and {pMCI}.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              The cross‐validated area under the receiver‐operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve for {sMCI} versus {pMCI} was 0.91 for neuropsychological features in contrast to 0.68 for neuroimaging features. The {BrainAge} delta was correlated with the time to conversion, the time taken for a {pMCI} subject to convert to {AD}.
            
            
              {DISCUSSION}
              The {BrainAge} delta from neuropsychological tests is a good biomarker to distinguish between {sMCI} and {pMCI}. Other neurological and psychiatric disorders could be studied using this strategy.

                    {BrainAge} models based on neuropsychological tests outperform models based on neuroimaging features when distinguishing between stable mild cognitive impairment ({sMCI}) from progressive {MCI} ({pMCI}) to Alzheimer's disease ({AD}).
                  
                  
                    The combination of neuropsychological tests with neuroimaging features does not lead to an improvement in {sMCI} versus {pMCI} classification compared to using neuropsychological tests on their own.

              Results
              
                Twofold: (1) From a list of preselected hypothesis‐driven genes, confirmatory analyses found that three genes play a major role in brain degeneration: dystrophin (

                , alpha‐synuclein (

                . Neuropathological analyses confirmed a highly heterogeneous Tau‐pathology in {DM}1, different to the one in Alzheimer's disease. (2) Exploratory analyses revealed gene clusters enriched for key biological processes in the central nervous system, such as synaptic vesicle recycling, localization, endocytosis and exocytosis, and the serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter pathways. {RNA} analyses confirmed synaptic vesicle dysfunction.

            Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 ({DM}1) is a multisystemic disease that affects gray and white matter ({WM}) tissues. {WM} changes in {DM}1 include increased hyperintensities and altered tract integrity distributed in a widespread manner.

Fractional anisotropy ({FA}) and mean diffusivity ({MD}) variations were assessed with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Transversal and longitudinal intra- and intergroup analyses were conducted, along with correlation analyses with clinical and neuropsychological data. At baseline, reduced {FA} and increased {MD} values were found in patients in the uncinate, anterior-thalamic, fronto-occipital, and longitudinal tracts. At follow-up, the {WM} disconnection was shown to have spread from the frontal part to the rest of the tracts in the brain. Furthermore, {WM} lesion burden was negatively correlated with {FA} values, while visuo-construction and intellectual functioning were positively correlated with global and regional {FA} values at follow-up. {DM}1 patients showed a pronounced {WM} integrity loss over time compared to {HC}, with a neurodegeneration pattern that suggests a progressive anterior–posterior disconnection. The visuo-construction domain stands out as the most sensitive neuropsychological measure for {WM} microstructural impairment.},

                {GCIPL} thickness in the parafoveal region (1‐ to 3‐mm ring) presented the largest reduction rate. The annualized atrophy rate was 0.63μm in {iPD} patients and 0.23μm in controls (
                p
                 {\textless} 0.0001). {iPD} patients with lower parafoveal {GCIPL} and {pRNFL} thickness at baseline presented an increased risk of cognitive decline at 3 years (relative risk [{RR}] = 3.49, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.10–11.1,
                p
                = 0.03 and {RR} = 3.28, 95\% {CI} = 1.03–10.45,
                p
                = 0.045, respectively). We did not identify significant associations between retinal thickness and motor deterioration.
              
            
            
              Interpretation
              Our results provide evidence of the potential use of optical coherence tomography–measured parafoveal {GCIPL} thickness to monitor neurodegeneration and to predict the risk of cognitive worsening over time in {iPD}. {ANN} {NEUROL} 2021;89:165–176},

            Phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 ({PTEN}) is a tumor suppressor and autism-associated gene that exerts an important influence over neuronal structure and function during development. In addition, it participates in synaptic plasticity processes in adulthood. As an attempt to assess synaptic and developmental mechanisms by which {PTEN} can modulate cognitive function, we studied the consequences of 2 different genetic manipulations in mice: presence of additional genomic copies of the Pten gene (Ptentg) and knock-in of a truncated Pten gene lacking its {PDZ} motif (Pten-Δ{PDZ}), which is required for interaction with synaptic proteins. Ptentg mice exhibit substantial microcephaly, structural hypoconnectivity, enhanced synaptic depression at cortico-amygdala synapses, reduced anxiety, and intensified social interactions. In contrast, Pten-Δ{PDZ} mice have a much more restricted phenotype, with normal synaptic connectivity, but impaired synaptic depression at cortico-amygdala synapses and virtually abolished social interactions. These results suggest that synaptic actions of {PTEN} in the amygdala contribute to specific behavioral traits, such as sociability. Also, {PTEN} appears to function as a bidirectional rheostat in the amygdala: reduction in {PTEN} activity at synapses is associated with less sociability, whereas enhanced {PTEN} activity accompanies hypersocial behavior.},

              For a wide range of cells, from bacteria to mammals, locomotion movements are a crucial systemic behavior for cellular life. Despite its importance in a plethora of fundamental physiological processes and human pathologies, how unicellular organisms efficiently regulate their locomotion system is an unresolved question. Here, to understand the dynamic characteristics of the locomotion movements and to quantitatively study the role of the nucleus in the migration of

              we have analyzed the movement trajectories of enucleated and non-enucleated amoebas on flat two-dimensional (2D) surfaces using advanced non-linear physical-mathematical tools and computational methods. Our analysis shows that both non-enucleated and enucleated amoebas display the same kind of dynamic migration structure characterized by highly organized data sequences, super-diffusion, non-trivial long-range positive correlations, persistent dynamics with trend-reinforcing behavior, and move-step fluctuations with scale invariant properties.

            Cortical spreading depression, a depolarization wave originating in the visual cortex and traveling towards the frontal lobe, is commonly accepted as a correlate of migraine visual aura. As of today, little is known about the mechanisms that can trigger or stop such phenomenon. However, the complex and highly individual characteristics of the brain cortex suggest that the geometry might have a significant impact in supporting or contrasting the propagation of cortical spreading depression. Accurate patient‐specific computational models are fundamental to cope with the high variability in cortical geometries among individuals, but also with the conduction anisotropy induced in a given cortex by the complex neuronal organisation in the grey matter. In this paper, we integrate a distributed model for extracellular potassium concentration with patient‐specific diffusivity tensors derived locally from diffusion tensor imaging data.},

            Individual‐based morphological brain networks built from T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) reflect synchronous maturation intensities between anatomical regions at the individual level. Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is a socio‐cognitive and neurodevelopmental disorder with high neuroanatomical heterogeneity, but the specific patterns of morphological networks in {ASD} remain largely unexplored at the individual level. In this study, individual‐based morphological networks were constructed by using high‐resolution structural {MRI} data from 40 young children with {ASD} (age range: 2–8 years) and 38 age‐, gender‐, and handedness‐matched typically developing children ({TDC}). Measurements were recorded as threefold. Results showed that compared with {TDC}, young children with {ASD} exhibited lower values of small‐worldness (i.e., σ) of individual‐level morphological brain networks, increased morphological connectivity in cortico‐striatum‐thalamic‐cortical ({CSTC}) circuitry, and decreased morphological connectivity in the cortico‐cortical network. In addition, morphological connectivity abnormalities can predict the severity of social communication deficits in young children with {ASD}, thus confirming an associational impact at the behavioral level. These findings suggest that the morphological brain network in the autistic developmental brain is inefficient in segregating and distributing information. The results also highlight the crucial role of abnormal morphological connectivity patterns in the socio‐cognitive deficits of {ASD} and support the possible use of the aberrant developmental patterns of morphological brain networks in revealing new clinically‐relevant biomarkers for {ASD}.},

            The human brain is an extremely complex network of structural and functional connections that operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Investigating the relationship between these multi-scale connections is critical to advancing our comprehension of brain function and disorders. However, accurately predicting structural connectivity from its functional counterpart remains a challenging pursuit. One of the major impediments is the lack of public repositories that integrate structural and functional networks at diverse resolutions, in conjunction with modular transcriptomic profiles, which are essential for comprehensive biological interpretation. To mitigate this limitation, our contribution encompasses the provision of an open-access dataset consisting of derivative matrices of functional and structural connectivity across multiple scales, accompanied by code that facilitates the investigation of their interrelations. We also provide additional resources focused on neuro-genetic associations of module-level network metrics, which present promising opportunities to further advance research in the field of network neuroscience, particularly concerning brain disorders.},

              Chloride is the most abundant permeable anion in the cell, and numerous studies in the last two decades highlight the great importance and broad physiological role of chloride currents mediated anion transport. They participate in a multiplicity of key processes, as for instance, the regulation of electrical excitability, apoptosis, cell cycle, epithelial secretion and neuronal excitability. In addition, dysfunction of Cl

              channels is involved in a variety of human diseases such as epilepsy, osteoporosis and different cancer types. Historically, chloride channels have been of less interest than the cation channels. In fact, there seems to be practically no quantitative studies of the dynamics of chloride currents. Here, for the first time, we have quantitatively studied experimental calcium-activated chloride fluxes belonging to
              Xenopus laevis
              oocytes, and the main results show that the experimental Cl

              currents present an informational structure characterized by highly organized data sequences, long-term memory properties and inherent “crossover” dynamics in which persistent correlations arise at short time intervals, while anti-persistent behaviors become dominant in long time intervals. Our work sheds some light on the understanding of the informational properties of ion currents, a key element to elucidate the physiological functional coupling with the integrative dynamics of metabolic processes.},

              Methods
              21 {DM}1 patients (pediatric onset: N = 9; adult/late onset: N = 12) and 18 healthy controls ({HC}) were assessed longitudinally over 9.17 years through brain {MRI}. Additionally, patients underwent neuropsychological, genetic, and muscular impairment assessment. Inter‐group comparisons of total and voxel‐level regional brain volume were conducted through Voxel Based Morphometry ({VBM}); cross‐sectionally and longitudinally, analyzing the associations between brain changes and demographic, clinical, and cognitive outcomes.
            
            
              Results
              The percentage of {GM} loss did not significantly differ in any of the groups compared with {HC} and when assessed independently, adult/late {DM}1 patients and their {HC} group suffered a significant loss in {WM} volume. Regional {VBM} analyses revealed subcortical {GM} damage in both {DM}1 groups, evolving to frontal regions in the pediatric onset patients. Muscular impairment and the outcomes of certain neuropsychological tests were significantly associated with follow‐up {GM} damage, while visuoconstruction, attention, and executive function tests showed sensitivity to {WM} degeneration over time.
            
            
              Interpretation
              Distinct patterns of brain atrophy and its progression over time in pediatric and adult/late onset {DM}1 patients are suggested. Results indicate a possible neurodevelopmental origin of the brain abnormalities in {DM}1, along with the possible existence of an additional neurodegenerative process. Fronto‐subcortical networks appear to be involved in the disease progression at young adulthood in pediatric onset {DM}1 patients. The involvement of a multimodal integration network in {DM}1 is discussed.},

              Physiological aging affects brain structure and function impacting morphology, connectivity, and performance. However, whether some brain connectivity metrics might reflect the age of an individual is still unclear. Here, we collected brain images from healthy participants (
              N
               = 155) ranging from 10 to 80 years to build functional (resting state) and structural (tractography) connectivity matrices, both data sets combined to obtain different connectivity features. We then calculated the brain connectome age—an age estimator resulting from a multi‐scale methodology applied to the structure–function connectome, and compared it to the chronological age ({ChA}). Our results were twofold. First, we found that aging widely affects the connectivity of multiple structures, such as anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices, basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, cingulum, hippocampus, parahippocampus, occipital cortex, fusiform, precuneus, and temporal pole. Second, we found that the connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to frontal areas, also known as the fronto‐striato‐thalamic ({FST}) circuit, makes the major contribution to age estimation. In conclusion, our results highlight the key role played by the {FST} circuit in the process of healthy aging. Notably, the same methodology can be generally applied to identify the structural–functional connectivity patterns correlating to other biomarkers than {ChA}.},

The method can be summarized as follows: (a) define, for each node, a distance matrix for the set of subjects by comparing the connectivity pattern of that node in all pairs of subjects; (b) cluster the distance matrix for each node; (c) build the consensus network from the corresponding partitions; and (d) extract groups of subjects by finding the communities of the consensus network thus obtained. Different from the previous implementations of consensus clustering, we thus propose to use the consensus strategy to combine the information arising from the connectivity patterns of each node. The proposed approach may be seen either as an exploratory technique or as an unsupervised pretraining step to help the subsequent construction of a supervised classifier.

              Background
              Retinal optical coherence tomography findings in Lewy body diseases and their implications for visual outcomes remain controversial. We investigated whether region‐specific thickness analysis of retinal layers could improve the detection of macular atrophy and unravel its association with visual disability in Parkinson's disease.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n = 63), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 8), and E46K mutation carriers in the α‐synuclein gene (E46K‐
                {SNCA}
                ) (n = 4) and 34 controls underwent Spectralis optical coherence tomography macular scans and a comprehensive battery of visual function and cognition tests. We computed mean retinal layer thicknesses of both eyes within 1‐, 2‐, 3‐, and 6‐mm diameter macular discs and in concentric parafoveal (1‐ to 2‐mm, 2‐ to 3‐mm, 1‐ to 3‐mm) and perifoveal (3‐ to 6‐mm) rings. Group differences in imaging parameters and their relationship with visual outcomes were analyzed. A multivariate logistic model was developed to predict visual impairment from optical coherence tomography measurements in Parkinson's disease, and cutoff values were determined with receiver operating characteristic analysis.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                When compared with controls, patients with dementia with Lewy bodies had significant thinning of the ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer complex within the central 3‐mm disc mainly because of differences in 1‐ to 3‐mm parafoveal thickness. This parameter was strongly correlated in patients, but not in controls, with low contrast visual acuity and visual cognition outcomes (
                P
                {\textless} .05, False Discovery Rate), achieving 88\% of accuracy in predicting visual impairment in Parkinson's disease.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                Our findings support that parafoveal thinning of ganglion cell–inner plexiform complex is a sensitive and clinically relevant imaging biomarker for Lewy body diseases, specifically for Parkinson's disease. © 2019 The Authors.

              Restoration of the communication between brain circuitry is a crucial step in the recovery of brain damage induced by traumatic injuries or neurological insults. In this work we present a study of real-time unidirectional communication between a spiking neuronal network ({SNN}) implemented on digital platform and an
              in-vitro
              biological neuronal network ({BNN}), generating similar spontaneous patterns of activity both spatial and temporal. The communication between the networks was established using patterned optogenetic stimulation via a modified digital light projector ({DLP}) receiving real-time input dictated by the spiking neurons’ state. Each stimulation consisted of a binary image composed of 8 × 8 squares, representing the state of 64 excitatory neurons. The spontaneous and evoked activity of the biological neuronal network was recorded using a multi-electrode array in conjunction with calcium imaging. The image was projected in a sub-portion of the cultured network covered by a subset of the all electrodes. The unidirectional information transmission ({SNN} to {BNN}) is estimated using the similarity matrix of the input stimuli and output firing. Information transmission was studied in relation to the distribution of stimulus frequency and stimulus intensity, both regulated by the spontaneous dynamics of the {SNN}, and to the entrainment of the biological networks. We demonstrate that high information transfer from {SNN} to {BNN} is possible and identify a set of conditions under which such transfer can occur, namely when the spiking network synchronizations drive the biological synchronizations (entrainment) and in a linear regime response to the stimuli. This research provides further evidence of possible application of miniaturized {SNN} in future neuro-prosthetic devices for local replacement of injured micro-circuitries capable to communicate within larger brain networks.},

	abstract = {Metastasis development represents an important threat for melanoma patients, even when diagnosed at early stages and upon removal of the primary tumor. In this scenario, determination of prognostic biomarkers would be of great interest. Serum contains information about the general status of the organism and therefore represents a valuable source for biomarkers. Thus, we aimed to define serological biomarkers that could be used along with clinical and histopathological features of the disease to predict metastatic events on the early‐stage population of patients. We previously demonstrated that in stage {II} melanoma patients, serum levels of dermcidin ({DCD}) were associated with metastatic progression. Based on the relevance of the immune response on the cancer progression and the recent association of {DCD} with local and systemic immune response against cancer cells, serum {DCD} was analyzed in a new cohort of patients along with interleukin 4 ({IL}‐4), {IL}‐6, {IL}‐10, {IL}‐17A, interferon γ ({IFN}‐γ), transforming growth factor‐β ({TGF}‐ β), and granulocyte–macrophage colony‐stimulating factor ({GM}‐{CSF}). We initially recruited 448 melanoma patients, 323 of whom were diagnosed as stages I‐{II} according to {AJCC}. Levels of selected cytokines were determined by {ELISA} and Luminex, and obtained data were analyzed employing machine learning and Kaplan–Meier techniques to define an algorithm capable of accurately classifying early‐stage melanoma patients with a high and low risk of developing metastasis. The results show that in early‐stage melanoma patients, serum levels of the cytokines {IL}‐4, {GM}‐{CSF}, and {DCD} together with the Breslow thickness are those that best predict melanoma metastasis. Moreover, resulting algorithm represents a new tool to discriminate subjects with good prognosis from those with high risk for a future metastasis.},

            Elucidating the intricate relationship between brain structure and function, both in healthy and pathological conditions, is a key challenge for modern neuroscience. Recent progress in neuroimaging has helped advance our understanding of this important issue, with diffusion images providing information about structural connectivity ({SC}) and functional magnetic resonance imaging shedding light on resting state functional connectivity ({rsFC}). Here, we adopt a systems approach, relying on modular hierarchical clustering, to study together {SC} and {rsFC} datasets gathered independently from healthy human subjects. Our novel approach allows us to find a common skeleton shared by structure and function from which a new, optimal, brain partition can be extracted. We describe the emerging common structure-function modules ({SFMs}) in detail and compare them with commonly employed anatomical or functional parcellations. Our results underline the strong correspondence between brain structure and resting-state dynamics as well as the emerging coherent organization of the human brain.},

              Protein tyrosine phosphatases ({PTPs}) regulate neuronal differentiation and survival, but their expression patterns and functions in human neuroblastoma ({NB}) are scarcely known. Here, we have investigated the function and expression of the non-receptor {PTPN}1 on human {NB} cell lines and human {NB} tumor samples.
            
            
              Material/methods
              {NB} tumor samples from 44 patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies against {PTPN}1, {PTPRH}, {PTPRZ}1, and {PTEN}. {PTPN}1 knock-down, cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation analyses, and {RT}-{qPCR} {mRNA} expression was assessed on {SH}-{SY}5Y, {SMS}-{KCNR}, and {IMR}-32 human {NB} cell lines.
            
            
              Results
              Knock-down of {PTPN}1 in {SH}-{SY}5Y {NB} cells resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation. Retinoic acid-mediated differentiation of {NB} cell lines did not affect {PTPN}1 {mRNA} expression, as compared with other {PTPs}. Importantly, {PTPN}1 displayed high expression on {NB} tumors in association with metastasis and poor prognosis.

	abstract = {Like many cancers, an early diagnosis of melanoma is fundamental to ensure a good prognosis, although an important proportion of stage I–{II} patients may still develop metastasis during follow‐up. The aim of this work was to discover serum biomarkers in patients diagnosed with primary melanoma that identify those at a high risk of developing metastasis during the follow‐up period. Proteomic and mass spectrophotometry analysis was performed on serum obtained from patients who developed metastasis during the first years after surgery for primary tumors and compared with that from patients who remained disease‐free for more than 10 years after surgery. Five proteins were selected for validation as prognostic factors in 348 melanoma patients and 100 controls by {ELISA}: serum amyloid A and clusterin; immune system proteins; the cell adhesion molecules plakoglobin and vitronectin and the antimicrobial protein dermcidin. Compared to healthy controls, melanoma patients have high serum levels of these proteins at the moment of melanoma diagnosis, although the specific values were not related to the histopathological stage of the tumors. However, an analysis based on classification together with multivariate statistics showed that tumor stage, vitronectin and dermcidin levels were associated with the metastatic progression of patients with early‐stage melanoma. Although melanoma patients have increased serum dermcidin levels, the {REPTree} classifier showed that levels of dermcidin {\textless}2.98 μg/ml predict metastasis in {AJCC} stage {II} patients. These data suggest that vitronectin and dermcidin are potent biomarkers of prognosis, which may help to improve the personalized medical care of melanoma patients and their survival.

            The discovery of serum biomarkers capable of predicting metastatic risk during post‐operative follow‐up in early‐stage primary melanoma patients could significantly benefit patient prognosis and survival. The present study identifies two promising biomarker candidates: vitronectin and dermcidin. Analysis and comparison of serum proteins in melanoma patients who either remained disease‐free or developed metastases in the years after surgery to remove primary tumors revealed a strong association between metastatic progression of early‐stage melanomas ({AJCC} stage {III}) and vitronectin and dermcidin serum levels. Further study of these proteins could open up new opportunities in the effort to improve long‐term survival among melanoma patients.},

However, {FC} also has the as yet unexplored potential to help us understand the pathological transformation of the brain circuitry. Our hypothesis is that {FC} can differentiate global brain interactions across a time-scale of days. To this end, we present a case report study based on a mouse model for epilepsy and analyze longitudinal intracranial electroencephalography data of epilepsy to calculate {FC} changes from the initial insult (status epilepticus) and over the latent period, when epileptogenic networks emerge, and at chronic epilepsy, when unprovoked seizures occur as spontaneous events. We found that the overall network {FC} at low frequency bands decreased immediately after status epilepticus was provoked, and increased monotonously later on during the latent period. Overall, our results demonstrate the capacity of {FC} to address longitudinal variations of brain connectivity across the establishment of pathological states.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) affects structural connectivity, triggering the reorganization of structural–functional circuits in a manner that remains poorly understood. We focus here on brain network reorganization in relation to postural control deficits after {TBI}. We enrolled young participants who had suffered moderate to severe {TBI}, comparing them to young, typically developing control participants. {TBI} patients (but not controls) recruited prefrontal regions to interact with two separated networks: (1) a subcortical network, including parts of the motor network, basal ganglia, cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala, posterior cingulate gyrus, and precuneus; and (2) a task-positive network, involving regions of the dorsal attention system, together with dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal regions. We also found that the increased prefrontal connectivity in {TBI} patients was correlated with some postural control indices, such as the amount of body sway, whereby patients with worse balance increased their connectivity in frontal regions more strongly. The increased prefrontal connectivity found in {TBI} patients may provide the structural scaffolding for stronger cognitive control of certain behavioral functions, consistent with the observations that various motor tasks are performed less automatically following {TBI} and that more cognitive control is associated with such actions.
          , 
            Author Summary
            Using a new hierarchical atlas whose modules are relevant for both structure and function, we found increased structural and functional connectivity in prefrontal regions in {TBI} patients as compared to controls, in addition to a general pattern of overall decreased connectivity across the {TBI} brain. Although this increased prefrontal connectivity reflected interactions between brain areas when participants were at rest, the enhanced connectivity was found to be negatively correlated with active behavior such as postural control performance. Thus our findings, obtained when the brain was at rest, potentially reflect how {TBI} patients orchestrate task-related activations to support behavior in everyday life. In particular, our findings of enhanced connectivity in {TBI} might help these patients overcome deficits in cerebellar and subcortical connections, in addition to compensating for deficits when interacting with the task-positive network. Hence, it appears that greater cognitive control is exerted over certain actions in order to overcome deficits in their automatic processing.},

              gene inactivation. The molecular events derived from this initial alteration lead to a permanent intracellular pseudo‐hypoxic status that stimulates vascular proliferation. The resulting increased intratumor angiogenesis is the target of most modern therapies. Although intratumor angiogenesis has received full attention in the last years, few studies have focused on its potential importance from a strict morphological approach. Intratumor angiogenesis has been analyzed in a retrospective series of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (n = 208) with long‐term follow‐up (n = 177). Two different patterns of angiogenesis have been highlighted with
              {CD}
              34 at the front of tumor invasion, termed continuous and discontinuous, respectively. The continuous pattern of angiogenesis showed a complete microvascular network surrounding totally tumor nests. Conversely, the discontinuous pattern displayed an incomplete network around tumor nests. The continuous pattern was associated to shorter 5‐year (p = 0.00064, hazard ratio = 2.8) and 15‐year (p = 0.014, hazard ratio = 1.7) survivals. Cox regression multivariate analysis also showed that the continuous pattern (p = 0.016373) remains a significant variable when considered together with grade (p = 0.001755) and stage (p = 0.000952). These findings support the notion that a continuous

This paper is a continuation of this work, but here we focus on {DAC} implementation in the Pathology Laboratory. In particular, we describe a new simple method that makes use of a cutting grid device and is applied to clear cell renal cell carcinomas for {DAC} implementation. This method assures a thorough sampling of large surgical specimens, facilitates the demonstration of intratumor heterogeneity, and saves time to pathologists in the daily practice. The method involves the following steps: 1. Thin slicing of the tumor (by hand or machine), 2. Application of a cutting grid to the slices (
              e.g
              ., a French fry cutter), resulting in multiple tissue cubes with fixed position within the slice, 3. Selection of tissue cubes for analysis, and finally, 4. Inclusion of selected cubes into a cassette for histological processing (with about eight tissue fragments within each cassette). Thus, using our approach in a 10 cm in-diameter-tumor we generate 80 tumor tissue fragments placed in 10 cassettes and, notably, in a tenth of time. Eighty samples obtained across all the regions of the tumor will assure a much higher performance in detecting intratumor heterogeneity, as proved recently with synthetic data.},

            Short-term synaptic plasticity contributes to the balance and regulation of brain networks from milliseconds to several minutes. In this paper we report the existence of a route to chaos in the Tsodyks and Markram model of short-term synaptic plasticity. The chaotic region corresponds to what in mathematics is called Shilnikov chaos, an unstable manifold that strongly modifies the shape of trajectories and induces highly irregular transient dynamics, even in the absence of noise. The interplay between the Shilnikov chaos and stochastic effects may give rise to some of the complex dynamics observed in neural systems such as transitions between up and down states.

            Short-term synaptic plasticity strongly affects the neural dynamics of cortical networks. The Tsodyks and Markram ({TM}) model for short-term synaptic plasticity accurately accounts for a wide range of physiological responses at different types of cortical synapses. Here, we report a route to chaotic behavior via a Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation that dynamically organizes some of the responses in the {TM} model. In particular, the presence of such a homoclinic bifurcation strongly affects the shape of the trajectories in the phase space and induces highly irregular transient dynamics; indeed, in the vicinity of the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation, the number of population spikes and their precise timing are unpredictable and highly sensitive to the initial conditions. Such an irregular deterministic dynamics has its counterpart in stochastic/network versions of the {TM} model: The existence of the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation generates complex and irregular spiking patterns and—acting as a sort of springboard—facilitates transitions between the down-state and unstable periodic orbits. The interplay between the (deterministic) homoclinic bifurcation and stochastic effects may give rise to some of the complex dynamics observed in neural systems.},

Now we test this protocol on routine hematoxylin-eosin ({HE}) sections in a series of 38 {CCRCC} cases. {MSTS} was found to outperform traditional sampling when detecting either high grade (p=0.0136) or granular/eosinophilic cells (p=0.0114). We therefore propose that {MSTS} should be used in routine clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Intratumor heterogeneity ({ITH}) is an inherent process in cancer development which follows for most of the cases a branched pattern of evolution, with different cell clones evolving independently in space and time across different areas of the same tumor. The determination of {ITH} (in both spatial and temporal domains) is nowadays critical to enhance patient treatment and prognosis. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ({CCRCC}) provides a good example of {ITH}. Sometimes the tumor is too big to be totally analyzed for {ITH} detection and pathologists decide which parts must be sampled for the analysis. For such a purpose, pathologists follow internationally accepted protocols. In light of the latest findings, however, current sampling protocols seem to be insufficient for detecting {ITH} with significant reliability. The arrival of new targeted therapies, some of them providing promising alternatives to improve patient survival, pushes the pathologist to obtain a truly representative sampling of tumor diversity in routine practice. How large this sampling must be and how this must be performed are unanswered questions so far.  Here we present a very simple method for tumor sampling that enhances {ITH} detection without increasing costs. This method follows a divide-and-conquer ({DAC}) strategy, that is, rather than sampling a small number of large-size tumor-pieces as the routine protocol ({RP}) advises, we suggest sampling many small-size pieces along the tumor. We performed a computational modeling approach to show that the usefulness of the {DAC} strategy is twofold: first, we show that {DAC} outperforms {RP} with similar laboratory costs, and second, {DAC} is capable of performing similar to total tumor sampling ({TTS}) but, very remarkably, at a much lower cost. We thus provide new light to push forward a shift in the paradigm about how pathologists should sample tumors for achieving efficient {ITH} detection.},

	abstract = {Dynamical models implemented on the large scale architecture of the human brain may shed light on how a function arises from the underlying structure. This is the case notably for simple abstract models, such as the Ising model. We compare the spin correlations of the Ising model and the empirical functional brain correlations, both at the single link level and at the modular level, and show that their match increases at the modular level in anesthesia, in line with recent results and theories. Moreover, we show that at the peak of the specific heat (the critical state), the spin correlations are minimally shaped by the underlying structural network, explaining how the best match between the structure and function is obtained at the onset of criticality, as previously observed. These findings confirm that brain dynamics under anesthesia shows a departure from criticality and could open the way to novel perspectives when the conserved magnetization is interpreted in terms of a homeostatic principle imposed to neural activity.},

	abstract = {The human brain generates a rich repertoire of spatio-temporal activity patterns, which support a wide variety of motor and cognitive functions. These patterns of activity change with age in a multi-factorial manner. One of these factors is the variations in the brain’s connectomics that occurs along the lifespan. However, the precise relationship between high-order functional interactions and connnectomics, as well as their variations with age are largely unknown, in part due to the absence of mechanistic models that can efficiently map brain connnectomics to functional connectivity in aging. To investigate this issue, we have built a neurobiologically-realistic whole-brain computational model using both anatomical and functional {MRI} data from 161 participants ranging from 10 to 80 years old. We show that the differences in high-order functional interactions between age groups can be largely explained by variations in the connectome. Based on this finding, we propose a simple neurodegeneration model that is representative of normal physiological aging. As such, when applied to connectomes of young participant it reproduces the age-variations that occur in the high-order structure of the functional data. Overall, these results begin to disentangle the mechanisms by which structural changes in the connectome lead to functional differences in the ageing brain. Our model can also serve as a starting point for modeling more complex forms of pathological ageing or cognitive deficits.},
