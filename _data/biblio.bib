              For a wide range of cells, from bacteria to mammals, locomotion movements are a crucial systemic behavior for cellular life. Despite its importance in a plethora of fundamental physiological processes and human pathologies, how unicellular organisms efficiently regulate their locomotion system is an unresolved question. Here, to understand the dynamic characteristics of the locomotion movements and to quantitatively study the role of the nucleus in the migration of
              Amoeba proteus
              we have analyzed the movement trajectories of enucleated and non-enucleated amoebas on flat two-dimensional (2D) surfaces using advanced non-linear physical-mathematical tools and computational methods. Our analysis shows that both non-enucleated and enucleated amoebas display the same kind of dynamic migration structure characterized by highly organized data sequences, super-diffusion, non-trivial long-range positive correlations, persistent dynamics with trend-reinforcing behavior, and move-step fluctuations with scale invariant properties. Our results suggest that the presence of the nucleus does not significantly affect the locomotion of amoeba in 2D environments.},

              Physiological aging affects brain structure and function impacting morphology, connectivity, and performance. However, whether some brain connectivity metrics might reflect the age of an individual is still unclear. Here, we collected brain images from healthy participants (
              N
               = 155) ranging from 10 to 80 years to build functional (resting state) and structural (tractography) connectivity matrices, both data sets combined to obtain different connectivity features. We then calculated the brain connectome age—an age estimator resulting from a multi‐scale methodology applied to the structure–function connectome, and compared it to the chronological age (ChA). Our results were twofold. First, we found that aging widely affects the connectivity of multiple structures, such as anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices, basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, cingulum, hippocampus, parahippocampus, occipital cortex, fusiform, precuneus, and temporal pole. Second, we found that the connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to frontal areas, also known as the fronto‐striato‐thalamic (FST) circuit, makes the major contribution to age estimation. In conclusion, our results highlight the key role played by the FST circuit in the process of healthy aging. Notably, the same methodology can be generally applied to identify the structural–functional connectivity patterns correlating to other biomarkers than ChA.},

            Short-term synaptic plasticity contributes to the balance and regulation of brain networks from milliseconds to several minutes. In this paper we report the existence of a route to chaos in the Tsodyks and Markram model of short-term synaptic plasticity. The chaotic region corresponds to what in mathematics is called Shilnikov chaos, an unstable manifold that strongly modifies the shape of trajectories and induces highly irregular transient dynamics, even in the absence of noise. The interplay between the Shilnikov chaos and stochastic effects may give rise to some of the complex dynamics observed in neural systems such as transitions between up and down states.

            Short-term synaptic plasticity strongly affects the neural dynamics of cortical networks. The Tsodyks and Markram (TM) model for short-term synaptic plasticity accurately accounts for a wide range of physiological responses at different types of cortical synapses. Here, we report a route to chaotic behavior via a Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation that dynamically organizes some of the responses in the TM model. In particular, the presence of such a homoclinic bifurcation strongly affects the shape of the trajectories in the phase space and induces highly irregular transient dynamics; indeed, in the vicinity of the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation, the number of population spikes and their precise timing are unpredictable and highly sensitive to the initial conditions. Such an irregular deterministic dynamics has its counterpart in stochastic/network versions of the TM model: The existence of the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation generates complex and irregular spiking patterns and—acting as a sort of springboard—facilitates transitions between the down-state and unstable periodic orbits. The interplay between the (deterministic) homoclinic bifurcation and stochastic effects may give rise to some of the complex dynamics observed in neural systems.},

            Clinical evidence based on real‐world data (RWD) is accumulating exponentially providing larger sample sizes available, which demand novel methods to deal with the enhanced heterogeneity of the data. Here, we used RWD to assess the prediction of cognitive decline in a large heterogeneous sample of participants being enrolled with cognitive stimulation, a phenomenon that is of great interest to clinicians but that is riddled with difficulties and limitations. More precisely, from a multitude of neuropsychological Training Materials (TMs), we asked whether was possible to accurately predict an individual's cognitive decline one year after being tested. In particular, we performed longitudinal modelling of the scores obtained from 215 different tests, grouped into 29 cognitive domains, a total of 124,610 instances from 7902 participants (40\% male, 46\% female, 14\% not indicated), each performing an average of 16 tests. Employing a machine learning approach based on ROC analysis and cross‐validation techniques to overcome overfitting, we show that different TMs belonging to several cognitive domains can accurately predict cognitive decline, while other domains perform poorly, suggesting that the ability to predict decline one year later is not specific to any particular domain, but is rather widely distributed across domains. Moreover, when addressing the same problem between individuals with a common diagnosed label, we found that some domains had more accurate classification for conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Down syndrome, whereas they are less accurate for Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis. Future research should combine similar approaches to ours with standard neuropsychological measurements to enhance interpretability and the possibility of generalizing across different cohorts.},

              INTRODUCTION
              BrainAge models based on neuroimaging data have diagnostic classification power but have replicability issues due to site and patient variability. BrainAge models trained on neuropsychological tests could help distinguish stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) from progressive MCI (pMCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
            
            
              METHODS
              A linear regressor BrainAge model was trained on healthy controls using neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging features separately. The BrainAge delta, predicted age minus chronological age, was used to distinguish between sMCI and pMCI.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The cross‐validated area under the receiver‐operating characteristic (ROC) curve for sMCI versus pMCI was 0.91 for neuropsychological features in contrast to 0.68 for neuroimaging features. The BrainAge delta was correlated with the time to conversion, the time taken for a pMCI subject to convert to AD.
            
            
              DISCUSSION
              The BrainAge delta from neuropsychological tests is a good biomarker to distinguish between sMCI and pMCI. Other neurological and psychiatric disorders could be studied using this strategy.
            
            
              Highlights
              
                
                  
                    BrainAge models based on neuropsychological tests outperform models based on neuroimaging features when distinguishing between stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) from progressive MCI (pMCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
                  
                  
                    The combination of neuropsychological tests with neuroimaging features does not lead to an improvement in sMCI versus pMCI classification compared to using neuropsychological tests on their own.
                  
                  
                    BrainAge delta of both neuroimaging and neuropsychological models was correlated with the time to conversion, the time taken for a pMCI subject to convert to AD.},

Integrated analysis of demographic data, images of the skin lesions, and serum and histopathological markers were analyzed in a group of 196 patients with melanoma. The interleukins (ILs) IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17A as well as IFNγ (interferon), GM-CSF (granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factor), TGFβ (transforming growth factor), and the protein DCD (dermcidin) were quantified in the serum of melanoma patients at the time of diagnosis, and the expression of the RKIP, PIRIN, BCL2, BCL3, MITF, and ANXA5 proteins was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in melanoma biopsies. An AI algorithm was used to improve the early diagnosis of melanoma and to predict the risk of metastasis and of disease-free survival. Two models were obtained to predict metastasis (including “all patients” or only patients “at early stages of melanoma”), and a series of attributes were seen to predict the progression of metastasis: Breslow thickness, infiltrating BCL-2 expressing lymphocytes, and IL-4 and IL-6 serum levels. Importantly, a decrease in serum GM-CSF seems to be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with early-stage melanomas.},

To this end, we present a case report study based on a mouse model for epilepsy and analyze longitudinal intracranial electroencephalography data of epilepsy to calculate FC changes from the initial insult (status epilepticus) and over the latent period, when epileptogenic networks emerge, and at chronic epilepsy, when unprovoked seizures occur as spontaneous events. We found that the overall network FC at low frequency bands decreased immediately after status epilepticus was provoked, and increased monotonously later on during the latent period.

In this study, individual‐based morphological networks were constructed by using high‐resolution structural MRI data from 40 young children with ASD (age range: 2–8 years) and 38 age‐, gender‐, and handedness‐matched typically developing children (TDC). Measurements were recorded as threefold. Results showed that compared with TDC, young children with ASD exhibited lower values of small‐worldness (i.e., σ) of individual‐level morphological brain networks, increased morphological connectivity in cortico‐striatum‐thalamic‐cortical (CSTC) circuitry, and decreased morphological connectivity in the cortico‐cortical network. In addition, morphological connectivity abnormalities can predict the severity of social communication deficits in young children with ASD, thus confirming an associational impact at the behavioral level. These findings suggest that the morphological brain network in the autistic developmental brain is inefficient in segregating and distributing information. The results also highlight the crucial role of abnormal morphological connectivity patterns in the socio‐cognitive deficits of ASD and support the possible use of the aberrant developmental patterns of morphological brain networks in revealing new clinically‐relevant biomarkers for ASD.},

	abstract = {The human brain generates a rich repertoire of spatio-temporal activity patterns, which support a wide variety of motor and cognitive functions. These patterns of activity change with age in a multi-factorial manner. One of these factors is the variations in the brain’s connectomics that occurs along the lifespan. However, the precise relationship between high-order functional interactions and connnectomics, as well as their variations with age are largely unknown, in part due to the absence of mechanistic models that can efficiently map brain connnectomics to functional connectivity in aging. To investigate this issue, we have built a neurobiologically-realistic whole-brain computational model using both anatomical and functional MRI data from 161 participants ranging from 10 to 80 years old. We show that the differences in high-order functional interactions between age groups can be largely explained by variations in the connectome. Based on this finding, we propose a simple neurodegeneration model that is representative of normal physiological aging. As such, when applied to connectomes of young participant it reproduces the age-variations that occur in the high-order structure of the functional data. Overall, these results begin to disentangle the mechanisms by which structural changes in the connectome lead to functional differences in the ageing brain. Our model can also serve as a starting point for modeling more complex forms of pathological ageing or cognitive deficits.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects structural connectivity, triggering the reorganization of structural–functional circuits in a manner that remains poorly understood. We focus here on brain network reorganization in relation to postural control deficits after TBI. We enrolled young participants who had suffered moderate to severe TBI, comparing them to young, typically developing control participants. TBI patients (but not controls) recruited prefrontal regions to interact with two separated networks: (1) a subcortical network, including parts of the motor network, basal ganglia, cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala, posterior cingulate gyrus, and precuneus; and (2) a task-positive network, involving regions of the dorsal attention system, together with dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal regions. We also found that the increased prefrontal connectivity in TBI patients was correlated with some postural control indices, such as the amount of body sway, whereby patients with worse balance increased their connectivity in frontal regions more strongly. The increased prefrontal connectivity found in TBI patients may provide the structural scaffolding for stronger cognitive control of certain behavioral functions, consistent with the observations that various motor tasks are performed less automatically following TBI and that more cognitive control is associated with such actions.
          , 
            Author Summary
            Using a new hierarchical atlas whose modules are relevant for both structure and function, we found increased structural and functional connectivity in prefrontal regions in TBI patients as compared to controls, in addition to a general pattern of overall decreased connectivity across the TBI brain. Although this increased prefrontal connectivity reflected interactions between brain areas when participants were at rest, the enhanced connectivity was found to be negatively correlated with active behavior such as postural control performance. Thus our findings, obtained when the brain was at rest, potentially reflect how TBI patients orchestrate task-related activations to support behavior in everyday life. In particular, our findings of enhanced connectivity in TBI might help these patients overcome deficits in cerebellar and subcortical connections, in addition to compensating for deficits when interacting with the task-positive network. Hence, it appears that greater cognitive control is exerted over certain actions in order to overcome deficits in their automatic processing.},

The objective of this study was to assess brain functionality and brain circuit alterations in a patient with an ultra-rare inborn error of cobalamin metabolism, methylmalonic aciduria, and homocystinuria due to cobalamin D disease, as compared with his twin sister as a healthy control (HC). We acquired magnetic resonance imaging (including structural, functional, and diffusion images) to calculate brain circuit abnormalities and combined these results with the scores after a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. As compared with HC, the patient had severe patterns of damage, such as a 254\% increment of ventricular volume, pronounced subcortical and cortical atrophies (mainly at striatum, cingulate cortex, and precuneus), and connectivity alterations at fronto-striato-thalamic circuit, cerebellum, and corpus callosum. In agreement with brain circuit alterations, cognitive deficits existed in attention, executive function, inhibitory control, and mental flexibility. This is the first study that provides the clinical, genetic, neuroanatomical, neuropsychological, and psychosocial characterization of a patient with the cobalamin D disorder, showing functional alterations in central nervous system motor tracts, thalamus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, that, as far as we know, have not been reported yet in vitamin B12-related disorders.},

            Elucidating the intricate relationship between brain structure and function, both in healthy and pathological conditions, is a key challenge for modern neuroscience. Recent progress in neuroimaging has helped advance our understanding of this important issue, with diffusion images providing information about structural connectivity (SC) and functional magnetic resonance imaging shedding light on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC). Here, we adopt a systems approach, relying on modular hierarchical clustering, to study together SC and rsFC datasets gathered independently from healthy human subjects. Our novel approach allows us to find a common skeleton shared by structure and function from which a new, optimal, brain partition can be extracted. We describe the emerging common structure-function modules (SFMs) in detail and compare them with commonly employed anatomical or functional parcellations. Our results underline the strong correspondence between brain structure and resting-state dynamics as well as the emerging coherent organization of the human brain.},

            Heart rate variability (HRV) abnormalities are potential early biomarkers in Parkinson’s disease (PD) but their relationship with central autonomic network (CAN) activity is not fully understood. We analyzed the synchronization between HRV and brain activity in 31 PD patients and 21 age-matched healthy controls using blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals from resting-state functional brain MRI and HRV metrics from finger plethysmography recorded for 7.40 min. We additionally quantified autonomic symptoms (SCOPA-AUT) and objective autonomic cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure and heart rate) during deep breathing, Valsalva, and head-up tilt, which were used to classify the clinical severity of dysautonomia. We evaluated HRV and BOLD signals synchronization (HRV-BOLD-sync) with Pearson lagged cross-correlations and Fisher’s statistics for combining window-length-dependent HRV-BOLD-Sync Maps and assessed their association with clinical dysautonomia. HRV-BOLD-sync was lower significantly in PD than in controls in various brain regions within CAN or in networks involved in autonomic modulation. Moreover, heart-brain synchronization index (HBSI), which quantifies heart-brain synchronization at a single-subject level, showed an inverse exposure–response relationship with dysautonomia severity, finding the lowest HBSI in patients with severe dysautonomia, followed by moderate, mild, and, lastly, controls. Importantly, HBSI was associated in PD, but not in controls, with Valsalva pressure recovery time (sympathetic), deep breathing E/I ratio (cardiovagal), and SCOPA-AUT. Our findings support the existence of heart-brain de-synchronization in PD with an impact on clinically relevant autonomic outcomes.},

            Beyond the characteristics of a brain lesion, such as its etiology, size or location, lesion network mapping (LNM) has shown that similar symptoms after a lesion reflects similar dis-connectivity patterns, thereby linking symptoms to brain networks. Here, we extend LNM by using a multimodal strategy, combining functional and structural networks from 1000 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. We apply multimodal LNM to a cohort of 54 stroke patients with the aim of predicting sensorimotor behavior, as assessed through a combination of motor and sensory tests. Results are two-fold. First, multimodal LNM reveals that the functional modality contributes more than the structural one in the prediction of sensorimotor behavior. Second, when looking at each modality individually, the performance of the structural networks strongly depended on whether sensorimotor performance was corrected for lesion size, thereby eliminating the effect that larger lesions generally produce more severe sensorimotor impairment. In contrast, functional networks provided similar performance regardless of whether or not the effect of lesion size was removed. Overall, these results support the extension of LNM to its multimodal form, highlighting the synergistic and additive nature of different types of network modalities, and their corresponding influence on behavioral performance after brain injury.},

            The human brain is an extremely complex network of structural and functional connections that operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Investigating the relationship between these multi-scale connections is critical to advancing our comprehension of brain function and disorders. However, accurately predicting structural connectivity from its functional counterpart remains a challenging pursuit. One of the major impediments is the lack of public repositories that integrate structural and functional networks at diverse resolutions, in conjunction with modular transcriptomic profiles, which are essential for comprehensive biological interpretation. To mitigate this limitation, our contribution encompasses the provision of an open-access dataset consisting of derivative matrices of functional and structural connectivity across multiple scales, accompanied by code that facilitates the investigation of their interrelations. We also provide additional resources focused on neuro-genetic associations of module-level network metrics, which present promising opportunities to further advance research in the field of network neuroscience, particularly concerning brain disorders.},

              Aim
              To delineate the neurogenetic profiles of brain degeneration patterns in myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1).
            
            
              Methods
              In two cohorts of DM1 patients, brain maps of volume loss (VL) and neuropsychological deficits (NDs) were intersected to large‐scale transcriptome maps provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). For validation, neuropathological and RNA analyses were performed in a small series of DM1 brain samples.
            
            
              Results
              
                Twofold: (1) From a list of preselected hypothesis‐driven genes, confirmatory analyses found that three genes play a major role in brain degeneration: dystrophin (
                DMD)
                , alpha‐synuclein (
                SNCA)
                 and the microtubule‐associated protein tau (
                MAPT)
                . Neuropathological analyses confirmed a highly heterogeneous Tau‐pathology in DM1, different to the one in Alzheimer's disease. (2) Exploratory analyses revealed gene clusters enriched for key biological processes in the central nervous system, such as synaptic vesicle recycling, localization, endocytosis and exocytosis, and the serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter pathways. RNA analyses confirmed synaptic vesicle dysfunction.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              The combination of large‐scale transcriptome interactions with brain imaging and cognitive function sheds light on the neurobiological mechanisms of brain degeneration in DM1 that might help define future therapeutic strategies and research into this condition.},

            Cortical spreading depression, a depolarization wave originating in the visual cortex and traveling towards the frontal lobe, is commonly accepted as a correlate of migraine visual aura. As of today, little is known about the mechanisms that can trigger or stop such phenomenon. However, the complex and highly individual characteristics of the brain cortex suggest that the geometry might have a significant impact in supporting or contrasting the propagation of cortical spreading depression. Accurate patient‐specific computational models are fundamental to cope with the high variability in cortical geometries among individuals, but also with the conduction anisotropy induced in a given cortex by the complex neuronal organisation in the grey matter. In this paper, we integrate a distributed model for extracellular potassium concentration with patient‐specific diffusivity tensors derived locally from diffusion tensor imaging data.},

            Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disease that affects gray and white matter (WM) tissues. WM changes in DM1 include increased hyperintensities and altered tract integrity distributed in a widespread manner. However, the precise temporal and spatial progression of the changes are yet undetermined. MRI data were acquired from 8 adult- and late-onset DM1 patients and 10 healthy controls (HC) at two different timepoints over 9.06 years. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) variations were assessed with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Transversal and longitudinal intra- and intergroup analyses were conducted, along with correlation analyses with clinical and neuropsychological data. At baseline, reduced FA and increased MD values were found in patients in the uncinate, anterior-thalamic, fronto-occipital, and longitudinal tracts. At follow-up, the WM disconnection was shown to have spread from the frontal part to the rest of the tracts in the brain. Furthermore, WM lesion burden was negatively correlated with FA values, while visuo-construction and intellectual functioning were positively correlated with global and regional FA values at follow-up. DM1 patients showed a pronounced WM integrity loss over time compared to HC, with a neurodegeneration pattern that suggests a progressive anterior–posterior disconnection. The visuo-construction domain stands out as the most sensitive neuropsychological measure for WM microstructural impairment.},

              Objective
              To characterize the progression of brain structural abnormalities in adults with pediatric and adult/late onset DM1, as well as to examine the potential predictive markers of such progression.
            
            
              Methods
              21 DM1 patients (pediatric onset: N = 9; adult/late onset: N = 12) and 18 healthy controls (HC) were assessed longitudinally over 9.17 years through brain MRI. Additionally, patients underwent neuropsychological, genetic, and muscular impairment assessment. Inter‐group comparisons of total and voxel‐level regional brain volume were conducted through Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM); cross‐sectionally and longitudinally, analyzing the associations between brain changes and demographic, clinical, and cognitive outcomes.
            
            
              Results
              The percentage of GM loss did not significantly differ in any of the groups compared with HC and when assessed independently, adult/late DM1 patients and their HC group suffered a significant loss in WM volume. Regional VBM analyses revealed subcortical GM damage in both DM1 groups, evolving to frontal regions in the pediatric onset patients. Muscular impairment and the outcomes of certain neuropsychological tests were significantly associated with follow‐up GM damage, while visuoconstruction, attention, and executive function tests showed sensitivity to WM degeneration over time.
            
            
              Interpretation
              Distinct patterns of brain atrophy and its progression over time in pediatric and adult/late onset DM1 patients are suggested. Results indicate a possible neurodevelopmental origin of the brain abnormalities in DM1, along with the possible existence of an additional neurodegenerative process. Fronto‐subcortical networks appear to be involved in the disease progression at young adulthood in pediatric onset DM1 patients. The involvement of a multimodal integration network in DM1 is discussed.},

	abstract = {Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is an inherent process in cancer development which follows for most of the cases a branched pattern of evolution, with different cell clones evolving independently in space and time across different areas of the same tumor. The determination of ITH (in both spatial and temporal domains) is nowadays critical to enhance patient treatment and prognosis. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) provides a good example of ITH. Sometimes the tumor is too big to be totally analyzed for ITH detection and pathologists decide which parts must be sampled for the analysis. For such a purpose, pathologists follow internationally accepted protocols. In light of the latest findings, however, current sampling protocols seem to be insufficient for detecting ITH with significant reliability. The arrival of new targeted therapies, some of them providing promising alternatives to improve patient survival, pushes the pathologist to obtain a truly representative sampling of tumor diversity in routine practice. How large this sampling must be and how this must be performed are unanswered questions so far.  Here we present a very simple method for tumor sampling that enhances ITH detection without increasing costs. This method follows a divide-and-conquer (DAC) strategy, that is, rather than sampling a small number of large-size tumor-pieces as the routine protocol (RP) advises, we suggest sampling many small-size pieces along the tumor. We performed a computational modeling approach to show that the usefulness of the DAC strategy is twofold: first, we show that DAC outperforms RP with similar laboratory costs, and second, DAC is capable of performing similar to total tumor sampling (TTS) but, very remarkably, at a much lower cost. We thus provide new light to push forward a shift in the paradigm about how pathologists should sample tumors for achieving efficient ITH detection.},

	abstract = {We recently showed that in order to detect intra-tumor heterogeneity a Divide-and-Conquer (DAC) strategy of tumor sampling outperforms current routine protocols. This paper is a continuation of this work, but here we focus on DAC implementation in the Pathology Laboratory. In particular, we describe a new simple method that makes use of a cutting grid device and is applied to clear cell renal cell carcinomas for DAC implementation. This method assures a thorough sampling of large surgical specimens, facilitates the demonstration of intratumor heterogeneity, and saves time to pathologists in the daily practice. The method involves the following steps: 1. Thin slicing of the tumor (by hand or machine), 2. Application of a cutting grid to the slices (
              e.g
              ., a French fry cutter), resulting in multiple tissue cubes with fixed position within the slice, 3. Selection of tissue cubes for analysis, and finally, 4. Inclusion of selected cubes into a cassette for histological processing (with about eight tissue fragments within each cassette). Thus, using our approach in a 10 cm in-diameter-tumor we generate 80 tumor tissue fragments placed in 10 cassettes and, notably, in a tenth of time. Eighty samples obtained across all the regions of the tumor will assure a much higher performance in detecting intratumor heterogeneity, as proved recently with synthetic data.},

The resulting increased intratumor angiogenesis is the target of most modern therapies. Although intratumor angiogenesis has received full attention in the last years, few studies have focused on its potential importance from a strict morphological approach. Intratumor angiogenesis has been analyzed in a retrospective series of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (n = 208) with long‐term follow‐up (n = 177). Two different patterns of angiogenesis have been highlighted with

              34 at the front of tumor invasion, termed continuous and discontinuous, respectively. The continuous pattern of angiogenesis showed a complete microvascular network surrounding totally tumor nests. Conversely, the discontinuous pattern displayed an incomplete network around tumor nests. The continuous pattern was associated to shorter 5‐year (p = 0.00064, hazard ratio = 2.8) and 15‐year (p = 0.014, hazard ratio = 1.7) survivals. Cox regression multivariate analysis also showed that the continuous pattern (p = 0.016373) remains a significant variable when considered together with grade (p = 0.001755) and stage (p = 0.000952).

              Chloride is the most abundant permeable anion in the cell, and numerous studies in the last two decades highlight the great importance and broad physiological role of chloride currents mediated anion transport. They participate in a multiplicity of key processes, as for instance, the regulation of electrical excitability, apoptosis, cell cycle, epithelial secretion and neuronal excitability. In addition, dysfunction of Cl
              −
              channels is involved in a variety of human diseases such as epilepsy, osteoporosis and different cancer types. Historically, chloride channels have been of less interest than the cation channels. In fact, there seems to be practically no quantitative studies of the dynamics of chloride currents. Here, for the first time, we have quantitatively studied experimental calcium-activated chloride fluxes belonging to
              Xenopus laevis
              oocytes, and the main results show that the experimental Cl

              currents present an informational structure characterized by highly organized data sequences, long-term memory properties and inherent “crossover” dynamics in which persistent correlations arise at short time intervals, while anti-persistent behaviors become dominant in long time intervals. Our work sheds some light on the understanding of the informational properties of ion currents, a key element to elucidate the physiological functional coupling with the integrative dynamics of metabolic processes.},

In this scenario, determination of prognostic biomarkers would be of great interest. Serum contains information about the general status of the organism and therefore represents a valuable source for biomarkers. Thus, we aimed to define serological biomarkers that could be used along with clinical and histopathological features of the disease to predict metastatic events on the early‐stage population of patients. We previously demonstrated that in stage II melanoma patients, serum levels of dermcidin (DCD) were associated with metastatic progression. Based on the relevance of the immune response on the cancer progression and the recent association of DCD with local and systemic immune response against cancer cells, serum DCD was analyzed in a new cohort of patients along with interleukin 4 (IL‐4), IL‐6, IL‐10, IL‐17A, interferon γ (IFN‐γ), transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐ β), and granulocyte–macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (GM‐CSF). We initially recruited 448 melanoma patients, 323 of whom were diagnosed as stages I‐II according to AJCC. Levels of selected cytokines were determined by ELISA and Luminex, and obtained data were analyzed employing machine learning and Kaplan–Meier techniques to define an algorithm capable of accurately classifying early‐stage melanoma patients with a high and low risk of developing metastasis. The results show that in early‐stage melanoma patients, serum levels of the cytokines IL‐4, GM‐CSF, and DCD together with the Breslow thickness are those that best predict melanoma metastasis. Moreover, resulting algorithm represents a new tool to discriminate subjects with good prognosis from those with high risk for a future metastasis.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Epilepsy, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures resulting from a wide variety of causes, is one of the world’s most prominent neurological disabilities. Seizures, which are an expression of neuronal network dysfunction, occur in a positive feedback loop of concomitant factors, including neuro-inflammatory responses, where seizures generate more seizures. Among other pathways involved in inflammatory responses, the JAK/STAT signalling pathway has been proposed to participate in epilepsy.
            Here, we tested an in vitro model of temporal lobe epilepsy, with the hypothesis that acute blockage of STAT3-phosphorylation during epileptogenesis would prevent structural damage in the hippocampal circuitry and the imprinting of both neural epileptic activity and inflammatory glial states. We performed calcium imaging of spontaneous circuit dynamics in organotypic hippocampal slices previously exposed to epileptogenic conditions through the blockage of GABAergic synaptic transmission.
            Epileptogenic conditions lead to epileptic dynamics imprinted on circuits in terms of increased neuronal firing and circuit synchronization, increased correlated activity in neuronal pairs and decreased complexity in synchronization patterns. Acute blockage of the STAT3-phosphorylation during epileptogenesis prevented the imprinting of epileptic activity patterns, general cell loss, loss of GABAergic neurons and the persistence of reactive glial states. This work provides mechanistic evidence that blocking the STAT3 signalling pathway during epileptogenesis can prevent patho-topological persistent reorganization of neuro-glial circuits.},

	abstract = {During the performance of a specific task--or at rest--, the activity of different brain regions shares statistical dependencies that reflect functional connections. While these relationships have been studied intensely for positively correlated networks, considerably less attention has been paid to negatively correlated networks, a. k.a. anticorrelated networks (ACNs). Although the most celebrated of all ACNs is the default mode network (DMN), and has even been extensively studied in health and disease, for systematically all ACNs other than DMN, there is no comprehensive study yet. Here, we have addressed this issue by making use of three neuroimaging data sets: one of N = 192 healthy young adults to fully describe ACN, another of N = 40 subjects to compare ACN between two groups of young and old participants, and another of N = 1,000 subjects from the Human Connectome Project to evaluate the association between ACN and cognitive scores. We first provide a comprehensive description of the anatomical composition of all ACNs, each of which participated in distinct resting-state networks (RSNs). In terms of participation ranking, from highest to the lowest, the major anticorrelated brain areas are the precuneus, the anterior supramarginal gyrus and the central opercular cortex. Next, by evaluating a more detailed structure of ACN, we show it is possible to find significant differences in ACN between specific conditions, in particular, by comparing groups of young and old participants. Our main finding is that of increased anticorrelation for cerebellar interactions in older subjects. Finally, in the voxel-level association study with cognitive scores, we show that ACN has multiple clusters of significance, clusters that are different from those obtained from positive correlated networks, indicating a functional cognitive meaning of ACN. Overall, our results give special relevance to ACN and suggest their use to disentangle unknown alterations in certain conditions, as could occur in early-onset neurodegenerative diseases or in some psychiatric conditions.},

              Restoration of the communication between brain circuitry is a crucial step in the recovery of brain damage induced by traumatic injuries or neurological insults. In this work we present a study of real-time unidirectional communication between a spiking neuronal network (SNN) implemented on digital platform and an
              in-vitro
              biological neuronal network (BNN), generating similar spontaneous patterns of activity both spatial and temporal. The communication between the networks was established using patterned optogenetic stimulation via a modified digital light projector (DLP) receiving real-time input dictated by the spiking neurons’ state. Each stimulation consisted of a binary image composed of 8 × 8 squares, representing the state of 64 excitatory neurons. The spontaneous and evoked activity of the biological neuronal network was recorded using a multi-electrode array in conjunction with calcium imaging. The image was projected in a sub-portion of the cultured network covered by a subset of the all electrodes. The unidirectional information transmission (SNN to BNN) is estimated using the similarity matrix of the input stimuli and output firing. Information transmission was studied in relation to the distribution of stimulus frequency and stimulus intensity, both regulated by the spontaneous dynamics of the SNN, and to the entrainment of the biological networks. We demonstrate that high information transfer from SNN to BNN is possible and identify a set of conditions under which such transfer can occur, namely when the spiking network synchronizations drive the biological synchronizations (entrainment) and in a linear regime response to the stimuli. This research provides further evidence of possible application of miniaturized SNN in future neuro-prosthetic devices for local replacement of injured micro-circuitries capable to communicate within larger brain networks.},

              This study was undertaken to analyze longitudinal changes of retinal thickness and their predictive value as biomarkers of disease progression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD).
            
            
              Methods
              
                Patients with Lewy body diseases were enrolled and prospectively evaluated at 3 years, including patients with iPD (n = 42), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 4), E46K‐
                SNCA
                mutation carriers (n = 4), and controls (n = 17). All participants underwent Spectralis retinal optical coherence tomography and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score was obtained in patients. Macular ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer complex (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness reduction rates were estimated with linear mixed models. Risk ratios were calculated to evaluate the association between baseline GCIPL and pRNFL thicknesses and the risk of subsequent cognitive and motor worsening, using clinically meaningful cutoffs.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                GCIPL thickness in the parafoveal region (1‐ to 3‐mm ring) presented the largest reduction rate. The annualized atrophy rate was 0.63μm in iPD patients and 0.23μm in controls (
                p
                 {\textless} 0.0001). iPD patients with lower parafoveal GCIPL and pRNFL thickness at baseline presented an increased risk of cognitive decline at 3 years (relative risk [RR] = 3.49, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–11.1,
                p
                = 0.03 and RR = 3.28, 95\% CI = 1.03–10.45,

              Background
              Retinal optical coherence tomography findings in Lewy body diseases and their implications for visual outcomes remain controversial. We investigated whether region‐specific thickness analysis of retinal layers could improve the detection of macular atrophy and unravel its association with visual disability in Parkinson's disease.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n = 63), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 8), and E46K mutation carriers in the α‐synuclein gene (E46K‐
                SNCA
                ) (n = 4) and 34 controls underwent Spectralis optical coherence tomography macular scans and a comprehensive battery of visual function and cognition tests. We computed mean retinal layer thicknesses of both eyes within 1‐, 2‐, 3‐, and 6‐mm diameter macular discs and in concentric parafoveal (1‐ to 2‐mm, 2‐ to 3‐mm, 1‐ to 3‐mm) and perifoveal (3‐ to 6‐mm) rings. Group differences in imaging parameters and their relationship with visual outcomes were analyzed. A multivariate logistic model was developed to predict visual impairment from optical coherence tomography measurements in Parkinson's disease, and cutoff values were determined with receiver operating characteristic analysis.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                When compared with controls, patients with dementia with Lewy bodies had significant thinning of the ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer complex within the central 3‐mm disc mainly because of differences in 1‐ to 3‐mm parafoveal thickness. This parameter was strongly correlated in patients, but not in controls, with low contrast visual acuity and visual cognition outcomes (
                P
                {\textless} .05, False Discovery Rate), achieving 88\% of accuracy in predicting visual impairment in Parkinson's disease.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                Our findings support that parafoveal thinning of ganglion cell–inner plexiform complex is a sensitive and clinically relevant imaging biomarker for Lewy body diseases, specifically for Parkinson's disease. © 2019 The Authors.

              Background
              Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) regulate neuronal differentiation and survival, but their expression patterns and functions in human neuroblastoma (NB) are scarcely known. Here, we have investigated the function and expression of the non-receptor PTPN1 on human NB cell lines and human NB tumor samples.
            
            
              Material/methods
              NB tumor samples from 44 patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies against PTPN1, PTPRH, PTPRZ1, and PTEN. PTPN1 knock-down, cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation analyses, and RT-qPCR mRNA expression was assessed on SH-SY5Y, SMS-KCNR, and IMR-32 human NB cell lines.
            
            
              Results
              Knock-down of PTPN1 in SH-SY5Y NB cells resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation. Retinoic acid-mediated differentiation of NB cell lines did not affect PTPN1 mRNA expression, as compared with other PTPs. Importantly, PTPN1 displayed high expression on NB tumors in association with metastasis and poor prognosis.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results identify PTPN1 as a candidate regulator of NB cell growth and a potential NB prognostic biomarker.},

	abstract = {Like many cancers, an early diagnosis of melanoma is fundamental to ensure a good prognosis, although an important proportion of stage I–II patients may still develop metastasis during follow‐up. The aim of this work was to discover serum biomarkers in patients diagnosed with primary melanoma that identify those at a high risk of developing metastasis during the follow‐up period. Proteomic and mass spectrophotometry analysis was performed on serum obtained from patients who developed metastasis during the first years after surgery for primary tumors and compared with that from patients who remained disease‐free for more than 10 years after surgery. Five proteins were selected for validation as prognostic factors in 348 melanoma patients and 100 controls by ELISA: serum amyloid A and clusterin; immune system proteins; the cell adhesion molecules plakoglobin and vitronectin and the antimicrobial protein dermcidin. Compared to healthy controls, melanoma patients have high serum levels of these proteins at the moment of melanoma diagnosis, although the specific values were not related to the histopathological stage of the tumors. However, an analysis based on classification together with multivariate statistics showed that tumor stage, vitronectin and dermcidin levels were associated with the metastatic progression of patients with early‐stage melanoma. Although melanoma patients have increased serum dermcidin levels, the REPTree classifier showed that levels of dermcidin {\textless}2.98 μg/ml predict metastasis in AJCC stage II patients. These data suggest that vitronectin and dermcidin are potent biomarkers of prognosis, which may help to improve the personalized medical care of melanoma patients and their survival.

            The discovery of serum biomarkers capable of predicting metastatic risk during post‐operative follow‐up in early‐stage primary melanoma patients could significantly benefit patient prognosis and survival. The present study identifies two promising biomarker candidates: vitronectin and dermcidin. Analysis and comparison of serum proteins in melanoma patients who either remained disease‐free or developed metastases in the years after surgery to remove primary tumors revealed a strong association between metastatic progression of early‐stage melanomas (AJCC stage III) and vitronectin and dermcidin serum levels. Further study of these proteins could open up new opportunities in the effort to improve long‐term survival among melanoma patients.},

METHODS: Thirty-six participants, 12 from each group, underwent a neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessment at both time-points. Functional connectivity of the resting state networks was compared between COVID-19 and HC while controlling for the effect of MOF. The association between functional connectivity and neuropsychological performance was also investigated. RESULTS: Compared to the HC, COVID-19 group demonstrated hypoconnectivity between the Default Mode Network and Salience Network. This pattern was associated with worse performance on tests of attention and information processing speed, at both time-points. CONCLUSION: The study of the association between cognitive function and brain functional connectivity in COVID-19 allows the understanding of the short- and long-term neurological alterations of this disease and promotes the development of intervention programs to improve the quality of life for this understudied population.},

The proposed approach may be seen either as an exploratory technique or as an unsupervised pretraining step to help the subsequent construction of a supervised classifier.

            Neurotransmitter exocytosis and short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) regulate large-scale brain electrical activity. This study is the first, to our knowledge, proposing a multiple-time-scale model that bridges between the microscopic and mesoscopic scales. It is parsimonious, yet with enough descriptive power to express, on the one hand, the interactions between the SNARE and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein complexes mediating all forms of neurotransmitter release and STSP and, on the other hand, the electrical activity required for neuronal communication. A key finding is the discovery of a mathematical structure, termed activity-induced transcritical canard, which quantifies and explains delayed and irregular exocytosis. This structure also provides a previously unidentified way to understand delayed and irregular processes sensitive to initial conditions across various biology processes.
          , 
            Communication between neurons at chemical synapses is regulated by hundreds of different proteins that control the release of neurotransmitter that is packaged in vesicles, transported to an active zone, and released when an input spike occurs. Neurotransmitter can also be released asynchronously, that is, after a delay following the spike, or spontaneously in the absence of a stimulus. The mechanisms underlying asynchronous and spontaneous neurotransmitter release remain elusive. Here, we describe a model of the exocytotic cycle of vesicles at excitatory and inhibitory synapses that accounts for all modes of vesicle release as well as short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP). For asynchronous release, the model predicts a delayed inertial protein unbinding associated with the SNARE complex assembly immediately after vesicle priming. Experiments are proposed to test the model’s molecular predictions for differential exocytosis. The simplicity of the model will also facilitate large-scale simulations of neural circuits.},

            Phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and autism-associated gene that exerts an important influence over neuronal structure and function during development. In addition, it participates in synaptic plasticity processes in adulthood. As an attempt to assess synaptic and developmental mechanisms by which PTEN can modulate cognitive function, we studied the consequences of 2 different genetic manipulations in mice: presence of additional genomic copies of the Pten gene (Ptentg) and knock-in of a truncated Pten gene lacking its PDZ motif (Pten-ΔPDZ), which is required for interaction with synaptic proteins. Ptentg mice exhibit substantial microcephaly, structural hypoconnectivity, enhanced synaptic depression at cortico-amygdala synapses, reduced anxiety, and intensified social interactions. In contrast, Pten-ΔPDZ mice have a much more restricted phenotype, with normal synaptic connectivity, but impaired synaptic depression at cortico-amygdala synapses and virtually abolished social interactions. These results suggest that synaptic actions of PTEN in the amygdala contribute to specific behavioral traits, such as sociability. Also, PTEN appears to function as a bidirectional rheostat in the amygdala: reduction in PTEN activity at synapses is associated with less sociability, whereas enhanced PTEN activity accompanies hypersocial behavior.},

Moreover, we show that at the peak of the specific heat (the critical state), the spin correlations are minimally shaped by the underlying structural network, explaining how the best match between the structure and function is obtained at the onset of criticality, as previously observed. These findings confirm that brain dynamics under anesthesia shows a departure from criticality and could open the way to novel perspectives when the conserved magnetization is interpreted in terms of a homeostatic principle imposed to neural activity.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Simultaneous mapping of multiple behavioral domains into brain networks remains a major challenge. Here, we shed some light on this problem by employing a combination of machine learning, structural and functional brain networks at different spatial resolutions (also known as scales), together with performance scores across multiple neurobehavioral domains, including sensation, motor skills, and cognition. Provided by the Human Connectome Project, we make use of three cohorts: 640 participants for model training, 160 subjects for validation, and 200 subjects for model performance testing thus enhancing prediction generalization. Our modeling consists of two main stages, namely dimensionality reduction in brain network features at multiple scales, followed by canonical correlation analysis, which determines an optimal linear combination of connectivity features to predict multiple behavioral performance scores. To assess the differences in the predictive power of each modality, we separately applied three different strategies: structural unimodal, functional unimodal, and multimodal, that is, structural in combination with functional features of the brain network. Our results show that the multimodal association outperforms any of the unimodal analyses. Then, to answer which human brain structures were most involved in predicting multiple behavioral scores, we simulated different synthetic scenarios in which in each case we completely deleted a brain structure or a complete resting state network, and recalculated performance in its absence. In deletions, we found critical structures to affect performance when predicting single behavioral domains, but this occurred in a lesser manner for prediction of multi-domain behavior. Overall, our results confirm that although there are synergistic contributions between brain structure and function that enhance behavioral prediction, brain networks may also be mutually redundant in predicting multidomain behavior, such that even after deletion of a structure, the connectivity of the others can compensate for its lack in predicting behavior.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Brain networks can be defined and explored through their connectivity. Here, we analyzed the relationship between structural connectivity (SC) across 2,514 regions that cover the entire brain and brainstem, and their dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). To do so, we focused on a combination of two metrics: the first assesses the degree of SC-DFC similarity -i.e. the extent to which the dynamic functional correlations can be explained by structural pathways-; and the second is the intrinsic variability of the DFC networks over time. Overall, we found that cerebellar networks have a smaller DFC variability than other networks in the brain. Moreover, the internal structure of the cerebellum could be clearly divided in two distinct posterior and anterior parts, the latter also connected to the brainstem. The mechanism to maintain small variability of the DFC in the posterior part of the cerebellum is consistent with another of our findings, namely, that this structure exhibits the highest SC-DFC similarity relative to the other networks studied, i.e. structure constrains the variation in dynamics. By contrast, the anterior part of the cerebellum also exhibits small DFC variability but it has the lowest SC-DFC similarity, suggesting a different mechanism is at play. Because this structure connects to the brainstem, which regulates sleep cycles, cardiac and respiratory functioning, we suggest that such critical functionality drives the low variability in the DFC. Overall, the low variability detected in DFC expands our current knowledge of cerebellar networks, which are extremely rich and complex, participating in a wide range of cognitive functions, from movement control and coordination to executive function or emotional regulation. Moreover, the association between such low variability and structure suggests that differentiated computational principles can be applied in the cerebellum as opposed to other structures, such as the cerebral cortex.},
