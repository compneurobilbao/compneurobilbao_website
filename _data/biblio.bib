	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Simultaneous mapping of multiple behavioral domains into brain networks remains a major challenge. Here, we shed some light on this problem by employing a combination of machine learning, structural and functional brain networks at different spatial resolutions (also known as scales), together with performance scores across multiple neurobehavioral domains, including sensation, motor skills, and cognition. Provided by the Human Connectome Project, we make use of three cohorts: 640 participants for model training, 160 subjects for validation, and 200 subjects for model performance testing thus enhancing prediction generalization. Our modeling consists of two main stages, namely dimensionality reduction in brain network features at multiple scales, followed by canonical correlation analysis, which determines an optimal linear combination of connectivity features to predict multiple behavioral performance scores. To assess the differences in the predictive power of each modality, we separately applied three different strategies: structural unimodal, functional unimodal, and multimodal, that is, structural in combination with functional features of the brain network. Our results show that the multimodal association outperforms any of the unimodal analyses. Then, to answer which human brain structures were most involved in predicting multiple behavioral scores, we simulated different synthetic scenarios in which in each case we completely deleted a brain structure or a complete resting state network, and recalculated performance in its absence. In deletions, we found critical structures to affect performance when predicting single behavioral domains, but this occurred in a lesser manner for prediction of multi-domain behavior. Overall, our results confirm that although there are synergistic contributions between brain structure and function that enhance behavioral prediction, brain networks may also be mutually redundant in predicting multidomain behavior, such that even after deletion of a structure, the connectivity of the others can compensate for its lack in predicting behavior.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Brain networks can be defined and explored through their connectivity. Here, we analyzed the relationship between structural connectivity ({SC}) across 2,514 regions that cover the entire brain and brainstem, and their dynamic functional connectivity ({DFC}). To do so, we focused on a combination of two metrics: the first assesses the degree of {SC}-{DFC} similarity -i.e. the extent to which the dynamic functional correlations can be explained by structural pathways-; and the second is the intrinsic variability of the {DFC} networks over time. Overall, we found that cerebellar networks have a smaller {DFC} variability than other networks in the brain. Moreover, the internal structure of the cerebellum could be clearly divided in two distinct posterior and anterior parts, the latter also connected to the brainstem. The mechanism to maintain small variability of the {DFC} in the posterior part of the cerebellum is consistent with another of our findings, namely, that this structure exhibits the highest {SC}-{DFC} similarity relative to the other networks studied, i.e. structure constrains the variation in dynamics. By contrast, the anterior part of the cerebellum also exhibits small {DFC} variability but it has the lowest {SC}-{DFC} similarity, suggesting a different mechanism is at play. Because this structure connects to the brainstem, which regulates sleep cycles, cardiac and respiratory functioning, we suggest that such critical functionality drives the low variability in the {DFC}. Overall, the low variability detected in {DFC} expands our current knowledge of cerebellar networks, which are extremely rich and complex, participating in a wide range of cognitive functions, from movement control and coordination to executive function or emotional regulation. Moreover, the association between such low variability and structure suggests that differentiated computational principles can be applied in the cerebellum as opposed to other structures, such as the cerebral cortex.},

              {INTRODUCTION}
              {BrainAge} models based on neuroimaging data have diagnostic classification power but have replicability issues due to site and patient variability. {BrainAge} models trained on neuropsychological tests could help distinguish stable mild cognitive impairment ({sMCI}) from progressive {MCI} ({pMCI}) to Alzheimer's disease ({AD}).
            
            
              {METHODS}
              A linear regressor {BrainAge} model was trained on healthy controls using neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging features separately. The {BrainAge} delta, predicted age minus chronological age, was used to distinguish between {sMCI} and {pMCI}.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              The cross‐validated area under the receiver‐operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve for {sMCI} versus {pMCI} was 0.91 for neuropsychological features in contrast to 0.68 for neuroimaging features. The {BrainAge} delta was correlated with the time to conversion, the time taken for a {pMCI} subject to convert to {AD}.
            
            
              {DISCUSSION}
              The {BrainAge} delta from neuropsychological tests is a good biomarker to distinguish between {sMCI} and {pMCI}. Other neurological and psychiatric disorders could be studied using this strategy.

                    {BrainAge} models based on neuropsychological tests outperform models based on neuroimaging features when distinguishing between stable mild cognitive impairment ({sMCI}) from progressive {MCI} ({pMCI}) to Alzheimer's disease ({AD}).
                  
                  
                    The combination of neuropsychological tests with neuroimaging features does not lead to an improvement in {sMCI} versus {pMCI} classification compared to using neuropsychological tests on their own.
                  
                  
                    {BrainAge} delta of both neuroimaging and neuropsychological models was correlated with the time to conversion, the time taken for a {pMCI} subject to convert to {AD}.},
