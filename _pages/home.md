As an energetic research team at the IIS Biobizkaia in Bilbao, our mission is to delve into and decode the complexities of the brain using advanced computational neuroimaging methods. Our focus includes the analysis of neural networks, brain connectivity, and the development of novel algorithms for understanding brain function and disorders. Our ultimate goal is to craft cutting-edge tools and methodologies to tackle the most pressing questions in neuroscience (see Research).

We are thrilled about the opportunity to grow and evolve within the vibrant scientific community of Bilbao. Our lab will be ideally situated to foster collaboration and innovation, sharing insights and ideas with leading researchers in computational neuroscience and related fields.

Our expansion process will be gradual, with significant milestones projected for the coming years.

Currently, we're based in the heart of Bilbao, at the IIS Biobizkaia, a hub for scientific excellence and innovation, home to a diverse community of researchers dedicated to advancing our understanding of the brain and nervous system.

We are thankful for the support from local and international funding agencies, including grants and awards that recognize our contributions to the field of computational neuroscience.
